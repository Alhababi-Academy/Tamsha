A Food Tour of Saudi Arabia: The 10 Dishes that Define a Cuisine,
Where and What to Eat in Saudi Arabia,"The capital’s culinary scene is thriving. From outstanding traditional cuisine to multiple Michelin-starred chefs plating just-so, there’s something for everyone.

The trendy Via Riyadh complex is the current epicentre of the city’s food scene. Concealed behind the panache of the mall’s Salmani architecture, you’ll find an array of international big-hitters. Gymkhana, with its ambiance of an elite club, offers the same mouthwatering modern Indian that brought its London branch a Michelin star.

There’s also Wolfgang Puck’s Spago, with its startling synthesis of culinary influences from three continents that won it two stars in Beverly Hills.

For something a little more casual, stop into Via Riyadh’s Les Deux Magots for French bistro classics. If you’d like to try Paris’ favourite burger, elbows at the ready—at the time of writing, Riyadh Ferdi is the most popular restaurant in Via Riyadh.

Prefer something a little more exclusive? Ascend to the Skybridge. Probably the most recognizable element of the Riyadh skyline, it’s possible, through Roam, to experience an intimate, candlelit three-course gourmet meal while seated 300 metres above the city streets.

Of course, while you’re travelling through Saudi, you’ll want to discover the local cuisine. In Riyadh, try Suhail, Takya, or Nadha Village for sumptuous menus. Or head to Diriyah—the UNESCO-protected village close to Riyadh that was the birthplace of the Saudi kingdom. After working up an appetite amid the historic architecture, sit down for traditional Saudi fine dining at Takya."
Saudi Arabian Cuisine Journey,"Would you like to take a journey discovering a whole new and unique cuisine? join me and learn more about the Saudi Arabian cuisine, its history, geographical impact on preparation or choices of food, and how those affect eating behaviors.

Saudi Arabia consist of many different terrain, with no doubt this has a great impact on the food choices based on the available resources. Interestingly, this gives every region of Saudi Arabia completely unique set of foods and drinks. For this particular reason, you will find it a joyful experience to eat around the kingdom moving from one region to the other.

Let me brief those terrain very simply. The central region is basically a desert land, surrounded by two major coastal regions the eastern and western regions; whereas southern region consist of many green highlands. So you can have a question jumping in your head now: how would the Saudi Arabian cuisine taste like?

Even though all cuisines are available nationally nowadays, let’s agree that every region have a geographical inspired recipes. Therefore; this can explain some of the regional related eating behaviors. For example: some of the central region residents highly dislike seafood, as they did not grew up eating it. Another good example: many people from the coastal regions consider central region food too dry and carbohydrate based compared to their iodine based diet.

One factor that has a high impact on the eating behavior in Saudi, is having parents from two or more different regions. You will find those families more open for different food choices, and more willing to try new things. I am born in family with a central and southern region roots (and other non-Saudi roots too). This makes my background strong in those two regions food more than other areas.

Historically, resources available in the central region were mainly: livestock (in which meats, dairy, and wild ghee and butter comes from) and grains. Whereas it was well known for eastern region residents to grow rice and various fruits and vegetables in their farm lands. And of course coastal areas are well known for their fresh seafood.

Now that you know a lot about our culture, history and geography you are ready to learn about our cuisine. In this article I am going to list the most famous dishes for each region, and those are the dishes that I will be describing in my following articles on weekly basis, so stay tuned for that! The names will sound gibberish with no sense at all at this stage, but I advise you to enjoy trying to pronounce them 🙂

Starting with the central region, famous savory dishes are: Kabsah, Jereesh, Qursaan, and Marqoq. Famous desserts are: date based (Honainee, Geshd and Mohalaa), Kleeja, and Masabeeb.

Southern region dishes are many, but I am more familiar with the sweet ones. Such as: Areekah, Mabthooth, Mashgooth and the tastiest local bread ever Qors or Gors.

Western region is a culture by its own when it comes to food! I am personally not an expert in their dishes. What am sure about is that most dishes there are seafood based such as Sayadiah, and the seafood vegetable casseroles.

I am a big fan of a none seafood based dish called Saleeg and absolutely will write an entire article about it.

Two of my favorite dishes that are shared between all regions: Edam (savory), and loqimat (dessert).

One article will be specified to describe the different ways of preparing rice; as it differs from region to the other as well.

Finally, I will not forget about the local beverages. Mainly beverages common here are hot such as: Geneger Milk, Mint Tea, Habag Tea (basil like herb), and Gesher (coffee peel).

You just used your eyes to read my article, read my next work to allow me stimulate the rest of your senses.

Saudi Arabia: A Taste of Its Highlights,"Tomb of Lihyan, Son of Kuza (Qasr Al Farid), Mada’in Saleh (Hegra Archaeological Site)

AlUla

Nestled in the northwest of Saudi Arabia, AlUla is an ancient oasis city that’s perhaps best known for Hegra (also known as Al-Hijr or Mada’in Saleh), Saudi Arabia’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site. Once a flourishing city of the Nabataean Kingdom, renowned for its sophisticated trade networks and rock-carved architecture, Hegra boasts stunning tombs and intricate facades that might remind you of Petra—it’s more famous sister city to the north, in present-day Jordan—which was the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom.

Nabataean Tomb at Hegra (Mada’in Saleh), AlUla

Another must-visit are the remnants of the ancient city of Dadan, capital of the Dadanite and later, Lihyanite Kingdoms—earlier civilizations that thrived before the Nabataean Kingdom. Often referred to as an ‘open-air library’, Jabal Ikmah is located near Dadan and is a treasure trove of ancient inscriptions, many of which date back to the Dadanite and Lihyanite periods.

Lion Tombs (square openings visible on the right side of mountain) in the rocks of Al-Khuraybah, Dadan

You can only visit these archaeological sites by joining a tour. Tours (as well as concerts, festivals and packages) can be booked on the Experience AlUla website. I booked the 3-hour Hegra Day Tour (SAR 95 / C$35 / US$25) and the 2.5-hour Dadan & Jabal Ikmah Day Tour (SAR 60 / C$22 / US$16). For the best photos, make sure to book the Hegra tour that starts about 3 hours before sunset (I purchased the tour starting at 2:30 pm).

AlUla Old Town

Although you can visit AlUla Old Town on your own, I booked the 1.5-hour Old Town Day Tour (SAR 70 / C$26 / US$19) which I highly recommend. Our small group was led by a rawi (literally, a ‘storyteller’ or special local tour guide) who provided insights into the region’s history and culture, and accompanied us to explore the ruins of mudbrick buildings and historic alleyways.

Remnants of AlUla Old Town, which is currently undergoing restoration

The towering rock formation, Elephant Rock (Jabal AlFil), is a must-see (best time is at dusk), and can be visited on your own. Maraya—a multi-purpose event venue and the largest mirrored building in the world—is also another popular attraction. If you just want to marvel at the structure’s exterior and get some cool photos, you can do so on your own; however, in order to gain access to its location in the Ashar Valley, you will need to either be a guest at one of the uber-luxurious resorts, Banyan Tree AlUla or Habitas AlUla, or have a reservation at one of their restaurants, or at Maraya Social. If you want to view the inside of the building, you will need a ticket to a concert or conference. Alternatively, you can book a guided tour. I made a reservation at Habitas AlUla’s restaurant, Tama, where I had an excellent meal, but unfortunately, I got lost trying to find Maraya, and by the time I arrived, it was already too dark to get any decent pictures!

While there are a number of upscale hotels and resorts in AlUla, prices for the more standard options are still pretty inflated. I stayed at Queen Hotel SAR 315/night (C$114 / US$85), which was the most highly-rated budget hotel with availability at the time. My room was clean, comfortable and very spacious (I discovered that most hotel rooms in Saudi Arabia are very big!), with a nice view of the mountains and a mosque. Nadim, the Bangladeshi hotel receptionist (you’ll find many foreign workers from places like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal) was very friendly and extremely helpful. The hotel is a bit out of the way (approximately halfway between the Old Town and the airport), but I wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again. It’s a 17-minute drive to the Old Town, 24 minutes to Dadan, and over 30 minutes to Elephant Rock and Maraya. Honestly though, regardless of where you stay, there’s going to be a lot of driving.

Madinah (Medina)

The highlight of Madinah is, of course, the Masjid al-Nabawi (Prophet’s Mosque). It’s the second largest mosque in the world, spread out over 20 acres (59 acres, including the courtyard)! Prior to 2021, non-Muslims weren’t even allowed in Madinah, so my arrival in the city was a true pinch-myself moment. There are still restrictions though. Non-Muslims are not permitted to enter the mosque, and I don’t believe they’re even allowed into the grounds of the mosque, although I’ve read that since April 2023, enforcement of the latter has been lax. Indeed, when I was there in December 2023, I did not encounter any issues entering through the perimeter gates into the northern courtyard. I spent a good amount of time walking around amongst Muslim pilgrims who’d come from all over the world (they probably thought I was one of them, just like how a shopkeeper had assumed I’d come to perform Umrah). I was even able to wander right up to one of the entrances of the mosque and take a peek inside. Every time I heard the ethereal call to prayer and watched pilgrims head towards the mosque, it was an awe-inspiring and profoundly moving experience.

While I was in Madinah, I also booked a Hop-on Hop-off Bus Tour of Madinah through City Sightseeing for US$21.76 (C$30), which was a convenient way to see other sites around Madinah and well worth the money.

Sadly, my accommodation at the Odst Al Madinah Hotel (SAR 389 per night /C$139 / US$104) was extremely disappointing. In fact, the whole experience—from check-in to check-out—was the worst I’ve ever had. When I arrived, there were hordes of people in the lobby and it was really chaotic. There were only 2 Front Desk staff who were clearly frustrated and overwhelmed, and people just kept cutting in line. When it was finally my turn to check in, I was told the king bed I’d booked was not available, and that I would have 2 single beds. Even though it was already 3:30 or 4 pm at the time, they said my room wouldn’t be ready for another hour. Instead of waiting around (there were no available seats in the lobby anyways), I asked to leave my suitcase behind the front desk, and I walked around the city carrying my big knapsack, which wasn’t ideal.

The room was very small—in stark contrast to all the other accommodations I stayed at in Saudi Arabia—and the bathroom hadn’t been cleaned properly. The toilet seat was wet, there was a hair on it, and I also found another hair in the sink. There was a window, but it was boarded up, with only a tiny opening at the bottom. Frankly, the only good thing about the hotel was its proximity to the Masjid (a 5-minute walk).

I discovered the food street in Madinah by accident, and couldn’t have been more excited! It’s a bustling area with vendors selling all kinds of international food—Afghan, Turkish…and even Malaysian food! There was so much I wanted to try, but I stuck with the local food—shawarma, muttabaq (likely the origin of Malaysian murtabak!) and kunafa. I tried Saudi coffee for the first time—it was amazing! Qahwa, as it’s known, is made with lightly roasted coffee beans infused with cardamom or other spices. It’s unsweetened but usually served with something sweet, like dates.

Jeddah

The main areas I explored in Jeddah were the Corniche (waterfront) and the historic city, Al-Balad. Jeddah is situated on the eastern coast of the Red Sea, and the 30-km long Corniche forms the western border of the city. I wandered along the promenade, all the way from the Jeddah Yacht Club & Marina down to the Jeddah sign. It’s a bustling area where you’ll find walkways and outdoor sculptures, cafes and restaurants, and see families gathering on big picnic rugs to enjoy meals. I whiled away the time by sipping on coffee, people-watching and enjoying the spectacular sunsets.

Al-Balad is another UNESCO World Heritage site, where you can see examples of traditional Hijazi houses with their characteristic windows (rawashin). Some of the more well-known and best preserved ancient houses are included in this list. The one drawback was the extensive restoration work during my visit, which made navigating the alleys a little confusing, with several dead-ends and sectioned-off areas. I spent a really long time searching in vain for the highly-recommended Historical Nights Rooftop Cafe. I was also really looking forward to trying some Saudi bread and pastries from the famous 200-year old Al Saidy Bakery, but I arrived to find that they had closed—for reasons unknown—so that was yet another disappointment! I did take some time out to enjoy qahwa at Roshan Cafe though.

I stayed at Staytion First-Al Zahra (now called Palm Boutique Al Zahra). My deluxe room turned out to be more like an apartment with a bedroom, huge living room and a kitchen. Surprisingly, for SAR 219/night (C$78 / US$58), this was actually the cheapest (and largest!) accommodation I had in Saudi Arabia. The staff were friendly and it was conveniently located within walking distance to restaurants and coffee shops, as well as Shatie Market, where I finally bought an abaya.

Sahlab – sweetened hot milk

At Samia’s Dish, just 500 metres from my hotel, I had the one of the best meals of my trip—Lamb Haneeth (slow-roasted lamb served with rice). Late one night I took a 4-minute stroll around the corner to a cafe, Darat Al-Qahwa, where I tried sahlab—sweetened hot milk topped with nuts, cinnamon and dessicated coconut—a perfect wintertime drink. A little further from my hotel was Meez, where I had tasty Middle Eastern fusion food.

Riyadh

When I first arrived in Riyadh, I just needed a place to stay for one night, close to the airport, and Super 8 Hotel Al Riyadh by Wyndham (SAR 454 per night / C$162 / US$119) was the least expensive option. In fact, it may be the only budget option you’ll find near the airport. After the SIM card fiasco—which I shared in the second part of this series—I really only spent maybe 2 hours in the hotel, which was rather unfortunate, because my king superior room was a really nice, modern suite with a king-sized bed in one room, a separate living area and the nicest shower.

On my return to Riyadh, I chose to stay in the central business district of Olaya, at the Ibis Riyadh Olaya Street Hotel (SAR 335 per night / C$119 / US$89), right across the street from Kingdom Centre, Riyadh’s second-tallest and most iconic building. I got to know Munif, one of the Front Desk staff, who was super friendly, and helped make my stay a pleasant one. He liked to crack jokes, was always full of compliments, and would offer me rides. He even helped me reschedule my trip to the Edge of the World.

Restaurants used to have separate sections for single men and another for women and families. Even though this has not been required as of Dec. 2019, I noticed a McDonald’s in Riyadh still had this sign.

I started my tour of Riyadh at the National Museum, which was a great first stop because it gave me a better understanding of Islam and the history of Saudi Arabia. I’d read that the entrance fee was only SAR 10 (C$3.56 / US$2.67), but for whatever reason, when I arrived, I just had to sign in and it was free!

A short 10-minute walk away is Murabba Palace, which is also worth a visit and houses some interesting exhibits. It was built in 1937 by King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the Kingdom. While it’s not as ornate as you might expect from a palace, its simple architecture is nonetheless beautiful.

Murabba Palace

I took a 25-minute Uber ride to the town of Diriyah—on the outskirts of Riyadh—the ancestral home of the Al Saud family (Saudi royal family) and the birthplace of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The main attraction is At-Turaif, with it’s striking mudbrick Najdi-style architecture. Overlooking this UNESCO World Heritage Site is Al Bujairi Terrace, which offers about 20 fine dining restaurant and cafe options. You are required to pre-book (online only) a date and time slot to visit At-Turaif, either with the free Diriyah Access Pass or a restaurant reservation with Access Pass. The latter includes dining at a restaurant of your choice. The cost will vary depending on the cost of the reservation, and you can redeem up to the value of the reservation fee on food and beverages at the restaurant.

Alley in At-Turaif, Diriyah

Diriyah is a must-see if you’re in Riyadh, but I should mention that I had a very frustrating experience with an unscheduled closure, so it’s something to keep in mind, if you’re planning a visit. I had booked my access pass for entry to At-Turaif betweeen 10 am and 4:59 pm. When I arrived, I was welcomed by a very nice man named Mohamed. I asked where I could buy some water, and he led me into one of the cafes and ordered a drink for me and refused to let me pay! Afterwards however, when I proceeded to the entrance of At-Turaif at around 1:15 pm, one of the guards told me it was closed and would re-open in 1.5 hours (which would be 2:45 pm). At the same time, he also gave conflicting information, saying that it would open again at 2 pm. I was slightly annoyed at this random closure and lack of an explanation and moved aside to wait while I finished my drink. Then another guard came to me and very rudely told me I could not stand there. There were many people walking around in that area, so I asked why I couldn’t wait there. His command of English wasn’t very good, but that didn’t excuse his rudeness. He used Google Translate to tell me, ‘You have to move’, but I thought he could have used the app to express his command more politely, or at least explain the reason for the closure. So I went out to the front entrance to look for Mohamed. He was very apologetic and told me that he had also just found out that At-Turaif was closed until 2 pm. Apparently there was some kind of VIP entourage touring the place or something. I thought this was a one-off occurrence, but then I read a review on TripAdvisor from a traveller who had had the same experience just a month earlier! Later, I ended up speaking to Fahad, the Senior Guest Relations Officer, who said that the sudden closures are due to restoration work being done. He apologized profusely and also expressed the staff’s frustration at not being informed beforehand of these closures. He walked me to the entrance of the site when it finally re-opened, and I did end up visiting At-Turaif.

Kingdom Centre in Riyadh

Kingdom Centre houses a mall, cinemas, the luxury Four Seasons Hotel, and at the very top is the Sky Bridge, which offers magnificent views of the city. I took the advice of some reviewers and went at 4 pm until sunset, so I could see both the daytime and evening views. I’ve seen many cities from high up, but somehow, seeing Riyadh from the Sky Bridge was so much more amazing than I had imagined. It’s SAR 69 (C$24.50 / US$18), but totally worth it!

Masmak Fort, Riyadh

I actually met another solo traveller, Larry, an American, while I was on the Sky Bridge. Together we decided to visit Masmak Fort in the ad-Dirah neighbourhood in the south of the city. While wandering around the nearby Souk Al-Zal, we met a Saudi woman, Jude, and her siblings, who initially wanted to invite us to their home for a meal! Since we didn’t have enough time to arrange a dinner, Jude invited us instead for qahwa. We then strolled around Deera Square, also known as Alsafat Square or more infamously, Chop Chop Square, the former site of public executions. It was surreal to be standing in the square, talking and laughing with newfound friends, while watching kids happily playing in the very spot where beheadings once took place.

Deera Square aka Chop Chop Square in Riyadh

You can’t really visit Riyadh without including Edge of the World in your itinerary. This natural wonder is only about 100km from the city, but it will take about 1.5 to 2 hours to get there by car since part of the journey involves off-roading. Even with a 4×4, it would be so easy to get lost if you’re not familiar with the rugged terrain. It’s therefore best to join a tour. I initially booked a tour with dinner (US$76.50 / C$110) through Booking.com with Riyadh Tours (Riyadh Hiking). But I didn’t get to the meeting point on time and missed joining the group. So then I booked a private driver directly with Riyadh Hiking for US$170 (C$227). He was not only a great guide, but an awesome photographer! Thanks to him, I got some amazing pictures. On the way back, he also stopped at a couple places to show me some traditional houses.

Edge of the World, 100km from Riyadh

Close to the Ibis hotel, I found excellent food at Taghmees, a casual joint located inside a less-than-spectacular mall. Ful (fava bean stew) and Hummus with Lamb Liver and Onions may not be everyone’s idea of breakfast, but it was certainly a hearty and delicious start to my first day in Riyadh.

Breakfast in Riyadh: Ful and Hummus with Lamb Liver & Onions and plenty of freshly-baked khubz (yeast-leavened flatbread)

The restaurant that’s most recommended in Riyadh is Najd Village. Larry and I visited one of their locations late one night, but they were about to close, so we had no choice but to order our food to go. The puffy tawa flatbread that I’d seen on the menu was unfortunately deflated by the time we got back to my hotel to eat it, but all the food was absolutely scrumptious!! I tried another lamb liver dish, accompanied with the tawa and also tamees, another kind of flatbread. I also had camel meat (Hashi Kabsah) for the first time, which was really good and not gamey at all!

Hashi Kabsah (Rice dish with Camel meat), Lamb Liver with Green Peppers and two kinds of flatbread

If you’re a lamb lover like me, Saudi Arabia is heaven! I don’t eat beef, and was expecting that there’d be a lot of beef on menus. Surprisingly though, beef is not that common. I found that the meat choices were mostly chicken or lamb, which suit me just fine! Najd Village, for example, doesn’t even have a single beef dish on their menu!

Having a meal the traditional way: seated on the floor and eating with hands

Saffron Cake and Saudi coffee (served in the traditional dallah) at Al-Masaa Cafe, the largest cafe in the world, with 1050 seats!

On my last evening, I managed to squeeze in a meetup with another new Saudi friend, Lulu. Lulu was back in Riyadh on a break from her studies in Manchester. I’d actually met her and one of her sisters the previous month on the flight from London. Lulu had wanted to take me to Boulevard World (the entertainment core of the annual Riyadh Season festival) but tickets were sold out. She also wanted to invite me to a shisha lounge but that plan fell through too. In the end, she and 2 of her sisters came to pick me up in their Range Rover, and we drove around listening to Khaleeji music until we finally settled on having coffee at Yamm Coffee Roasters. We then drove through Laysen Valley—a new innovative mixed-use development near the Diplomatic Quarter—which showcases lots of upscale international restaurants and unique concept stores, and was teeming with a young, hip crowd on a Friday night.

When I mentioned that I hadn’t yet tried Al Baik (the popular Saudi fast food chain) because the queues were always so long, Lulu drove to an Al Baik outlet, where I followed one of her sisters inside and watched her exchange a few words with the manager. Within minutes, we left with a chicken nugget meal and a shrimp meal. We pulled into the parking lot of a Starbucks where I had a taste of the shrimp while I waited for my Uber ride. I didn’t have time to try the chicken nuggets, but they insisted that I take the whole meal with me and eat it at the airport!

Additional Helpful Tips

Contactless payment is widely available in Saudi Arabia. I exchanged dollars for some riyals when I first arrived in Riyadh, but once I used that up, I just paid for everything by tapping my credit card. That being said, it’s never a bad idea to always keep some cash on hand, especially for unexpected situations. In fact, when I changed my booking for Edge of the World at the last minute, Riyadh Hiking would only accept payment in cash.

The weekend in Saudi Arabia is Friday and Saturday. So some shops and tourist sites may not be open or may only be open in the evenings. If you need to go to a bank, it’s important to remember that they’re closed on Fridays! I learned this the hard way when I tried to find a bank to withdraw money to pay Riyadh Hiking, and then realized none were open because it was a Friday (I was able to access an ATM machine at one of the banks, but it didn’t accept my credit or debit cards)! As it was my last day in Riyadh, I got into a bit of a panic, thinking I was going to miss my chance to visit Edge of the World! In the end, they gave me the option to transfer the money via PayPal, which was a huge relief!

Another thing to be mindful of is prayer time in Saudi Arabia, which occurs 5 times a day. Oftentimes, places will remain open, but there’ll be no one around to serve you. I remember one instance at my hotel in Jeddah. I went to the Front Desk to ask a question, but there was no one there, nor was there any sign or notice. Then I caught a glimpse of a man kneeling behind the front desk, seemingly ignoring me, and then it dawned on me that he was praying.

Final Thoughts

Things in Saudi Arabia have been changing at an incredible pace in recent years, and they continue to evolve rapidly. Even if you think you’re well-prepared, it’s likely that some information will be outdated by the time you arrive. But that’s part of the excitement of travelling—you’ll always find surprises along the way!

Since Saudi Arabia was technically a stopover for me on both visits, I didn’t spend as much time in the country as I would have liked. However, I’m thrilled that, even with limited time, I managed to experience so much. While a short visit doesn’t allow for a deep understanding of the people and their ways, it’s certainly a fantastic introduction to the country.

What I do know is that Saudi Arabia is not just what we often hear about in the media. It’s a country in transition, racing toward Vision 2030. It’s more than just the desert. There are breathtaking mountainous landscapes and untouched coastal waters with spectacular diving spots.

I loved the nightlife in Saudi Arabia—not in the sense of clubs and bars, but the lively coffee culture and the vibrant energy that comes alive late at night, when people are out and about. Having the opportunity to truly meet and interact with the locals was one of the highlights of my time there. The people I met were incredibly friendly and hospitable, making my departure bittersweet—I can’t wait to visit again!

1. Getting to AlUla

AlUla is well-connected by air, road, and rail, making it relatively easy to reach. The closest airport to AlUla is Prince Abdul Majeed bin Abdulaziz Airport (ULH), which receives both domestic and international flights. You can also reach Alula by car from cities like Medina or Riyadh, with scenic desert drives awaiting you. I chose to fly into Jeddah from Dubai, spend two days in Jeddah exploring and snorkeling and then I took a short flight to AlUla. (Also flying in and out of Saudi, the airlines are also dry, so enjoy apple juice instead.

2. Visa Requirements

Before packing your bags for AlUla, it’s crucial to understand Saudi Arabia’s visa requirements. While Saudi Arabia has made significant strides in opening up to tourism, it still requires most travelers to obtain a tourist visa. The process involves applying online, paying a fee, and providing the necessary documentation. Ensure you check the latest visa regulations as they may change. It really is a pretty user friendly seamless process so don’t let the need to obtain one discourage you. I got mine almost immediately.

3. Weather and Best Time to Visit

AlUla experiences a desert climate with extremely hot summers and mild winters. The best time to visit is during the winter months, from November to February when temperatures are more bearable for outdoor activities. Be prepared for chilly nights, though, as temperatures can drop significantly. I went over Christmas and wished it were a bit hotter to enjoy the pools and not be so cold in the evenings for the beautiful outdoor dinners. If you do choose to go in winter, take a warm coat and some sweaters.

4. Top Attractions and Activities

Hegra/day and night experience

Madain Saleh, also known as Hegra or Al-Hijr, is the crown jewel of Alula’s historical sites and a UNESCO World Heritage site. These ancient Nabatean tombs date back to the first century BC and are often referred to as the “southern Petra” due to their architectural resemblance to the famous Jordanian site. Explore the tombs, learn about the history, and marvel at the intricate carvings. This site was on my vision board as I had been dreaming of visiting it for years after falling in love with neighboring Jordan and another Nabatean city called Petra. If you loved Petra, then you will surely love Hegra. I would recommend doing both Hegra by day and then the night experience as in the night it’s the most magical experience of my entire life. truly. You can not miss Hegra by night.

The Elephant Rock

Aptly named, The Elephant Rock is a natural wonder that resembles an elephant with its trunk dipped into a watering hole. This geological formation is a favorite spot for photographers and a fun stop on your Alula journey. There is an adorable little cafe and some ice cream carts there to enjoy and relax while taking in the atmosphere and view of Elephant Rock. It was another one of my favorite parts of AlUla.

.

AlUla Old Town

Step back in time by visiting AlUla Old Town, where you can wander through narrow alleys and experience traditional Saudi architecture. Don’t miss the chance to interact with locals and taste traditional cuisine. There are many authentic shops and an extreamely old Dunkin Donuts. I went to a Saudi celebration in Old Town to really get to know the culture, have some coffee, and see the dynamic changes the city is going through, truly offering the most to its tourists.

Dadan Archaeological Park

Dadan was the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Lihyan and holds historical significance. Explore the archaeological remains, including temples, inscriptions, and tombs, which offer a glimpse into the region’s rich history. The writing alone are incredible, you will see messages and scriptures from hundreds of years back. There are many different fonts and languages and it’s truly enchanting to walk through. Another do not miss spot in AlUla.

Maraya

Maraya, meaning “Mirror” or “reflection in Arabic. Maraya AlUla, often referred to simply as Maraya, is a remarkable architectural wonder and a symbol of modernity amidst the historical and natural beauty of AlUla, Saudi Arabia. This stunning mirrored structure is the largest mirror-clad building in the world, designed to blend seamlessly with its desert surroundings while offering a contemporary twist. Maraya is not just a visual masterpiece but also a versatile venue that hosts a variety of events, from cultural performances and conferences to exhibitions and entertainment shows. With its ethereal reflective exterior, Maraya AlUla captures the essence of AlUla’s unique blend of tradition and innovation, making it a must-visit attraction that adds to the allure of this captivating destination. I visited a concert here and although it was an Arabic singer that I wasn’t familiar with, the experience all around was sensational nonetheless.

Adventure Activities

AlUla offers a variety of outdoor adventures. Try hot air ballooning for a bird’s-eye view of the breathtaking landscapes, embark on a desert safari, set out horseback riding or go hiking in the nearby mountains. I did all of these, and I would say the hot air ballooning is an experience you can’t miss, from the outerworldly rock formations to the palm tree Oasis, you will be mesmerized and get a new perspective of the city. I also loved horseback riding as I’m a keen fan of horses and they all seemed to be really taken great care of.

5. Frequently Asked Questions About Travel to Saudi Arabia

Q1: Is it safe to travel to Saudi Arabia? A1: Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in tourism infrastructure and safety measures. However, like any destination, it’s essential to stay informed about the current situation and follow local guidelines. I however, felt completely and utterly safe there and had zero issues. I would even go as far as to saying you could be safe here as a solo female traveler.

Q2: What should I wear when visiting AlUla? A2: Saudi Arabia has a conservative dress code. Saudi women typically wear an abaya (a loose black cloak) in public, while men dress modestly. However, in tourist areas, the dress code is more relaxed. Always be respectful by covering legs, breasts, shoulders. Covering your hair is no longer needed but remember you are in a Muslim country so dress appropriately and respectfully. Swimwear I would recommend a one piece and linen shirt to cover. Locals will not typically wear Western swimwear but I was ok in a one piece.

This critically acclaimed restaurant in Riyadh lies nestled at the high-end Centria Mall. Lusin takes its name from the Armenian word for ‘moon.’

Riyadh has experienced a wave of burger joints in recent years. These pop-ups serve all sorts of new takes on classic fast food. Hamburgini has taken a straightforward, no-gimmicks approach to its burger menu. It’s simple:

Choose chicken or a beef burger.

A single, double, or even triple patty.

Pick your fresh toppings and sauces, and combine them with an order of fries and a drink.

Additionally, the interior is orange, neat, and bright, with aesthetics that particularly appeal to a younger crowd. This restaurant serves some of the most affordable burgers in town.

Recommended: Riyadh restaurants bring global cuisines together

A single patty burger costs around SAR 10 (£2). This is much below a burger’s price at a similar eatery.

Güllüoğlu Restaurant in Riyadh

The famous family-run baklava shop first started in Turkey in the late 1800s. Over time, its business expanded to dozens of sweet shops, cafés, dining restaurants, and even a cooking school. That trains the best baklava chefs.

A few years ago, the baklava empire arrived in Saudi Arabia, with Gulluoglu opening its first branch in Riyadh. It has since become the go-to place for Turkish buffets in the capital.

Both restaurants offer à la carte menu as well as a buffet.

Experienced Turkish chefs prepare traditional flatbread pides, a dozen types of chicken, lamb, beef kebabs, and other grills.

Gulluoglu’s sweet counter is the star attraction, with a range of desserts mostly imported from Turkey, while their world-famous baklavas are made fresh in-house."
Where and What to Eat in Saudi Arabia,"The capital’s culinary scene is thriving. From outstanding traditional cuisine to multiple Michelin-starred chefs plating just-so, there’s something for everyone.

The trendy Via Riyadh complex is the current epicentre of the city’s food scene. Concealed behind the panache of the mall’s Salmani architecture, you’ll find an array of international big-hitters. Gymkhana, with its ambiance of an elite club, offers the same mouthwatering modern Indian that brought its London branch a Michelin star.

There’s also Wolfgang Puck’s Spago, with its startling synthesis of culinary influences from three continents that won it two stars in Beverly Hills.

For something a little more casual, stop into Via Riyadh’s Les Deux Magots for French bistro classics. If you’d like to try Paris’ favourite burger, elbows at the ready—at the time of writing, Riyadh Ferdi is the most popular restaurant in Via Riyadh.

Prefer something a little more exclusive? Ascend to the Skybridge. Probably the most recognizable element of the Riyadh skyline, it’s possible, through Roam, to experience an intimate, candlelit three-course gourmet meal while seated 300 metres above the city streets.

Of course, while you’re travelling through Saudi, you’ll want to discover the local cuisine. In Riyadh, try Suhail, Takya, or Nadha Village for sumptuous menus. Or head to Diriyah—the UNESCO-protected village close to Riyadh that was the birthplace of the Saudi kingdom. After working up an appetite amid the historic architecture, sit down for traditional Saudi fine dining at Takya."

Fans love this Saudi café for the logo alone (it’s a rabbit donning a hat, people), but it perfectly nails the essence of what the place is all about – approachable and it doesn’t take itself too seriously. Archi serves super sandwiches, delicious desserts and coffee that would please even the most discerning coffee-head. Plus, most of its outlets are open until 2am, and on weekends. You might find it crowded even post-midnight. This brand is like the master of hype. Archi had its followers on social media hooked with little glimpses of its new café that was covered in bubble wrap. When it finally uncovered the place, it was like a magnet for the crowds.

Aseeb, Riyadh

This restaurant opened its doors earlier this year by a loveable couple, Abu Saud and Umm Saud. Their shared love for Najdi cuisine shines in every dish, but what sets the place apart from the more commercial Najdi restaurants out there is that they’ve shown no compromise when sticking to their roots – they even use palm fronds in some dishes that, to put it simply, work wonders. If you ask someone to recommend a Saudi restaurant in Riyadh, there’s a good possibility you’ll be directed here – and for a good reason.

The coffee culture in the city is hard to match, as it’s chockablock with places that serve specialty brews. Ashjar Café has managed to stand out from the rest since its debut in 2020 by building a loyal community who take part in creative workshops every month that cover everything from the basics of Arabic calligraphy to pottery making. You can also get involved in pot painting, kids’ activities, literary discussions, lino block painting and more. You’ll be returning regularly for new menu items (ice cream, anyone?). Even when there are no classes going on, the venue draws a crowd of eager customers ready and waiting for the speciality coffee and sweets.

Brew92, Jeddah and Riyadh

This specialty café and roastery kicked off its ventures in 2016 with a team of coffee virtuosos, artistic roasters and barista enthusiasts. From using specialty-grade Arabica beans to boasting a team that’s pro-level trained according to the Speciality Coffee Association Standards, coffee is a serious affair here. Back in 2018, the team threw down $105 for a pound of Gori Gesha beans at an auction in Ethiopia – setting the record for the highest price ever paid for African beans at the auction. And that 92 in Brew92? It refers to the average temperature at which coffee is brewed here – 92°C. Whether you’re equally a coffee aficionado or you don’t exactly know your latte from your cappuccino, Brew92 is a welcoming place to get your cuppa at all hours. We now have more and more options to have a coffee break at Brew92 because the venue has expanded with massive flagship locations in Riyadh and Jeddah, with plans to launch even more stores.

Camel Step took its first “steps” in 2013 by setting out to provide primo coffee beans and spread love for specialty sips in the local scene. Over the years, they’ve aced it without falling for viral trends, absolutely no fluff, just fantastic coffee. No wonder they now run cafés all over the map. In a sea of sameness, Camel Step stands out for its singular vision, which is why it has many loyal fans. The brand isn’t shouting about how great it is or separating itself with gimmicks. It’s actually the complete opposite. The home-grown roastery and coffee spot remains focused on a quality cuppa and coffee kit. Additionally, Camel Step expanded this year with a new Riyadh branch dedicated to maintenance and after-sales services.

This female-run breakfast spot in Jeddah is helmed by chef Amal Fakieh. The story behind its unique name is as interesting as the food served here. If you’d dial 17 on the intercom at the founder’s home, you’d reach the living room, which was a cosy hub for long, fuzzy conversations. Today, Ext. Seventeen keeps that welcoming vibe alive. Since 2020, it has been offering up scrumptious breakfasts and a space for those heart-filled talks. Speaking of heart, the home-grown restaurant and Fakieh are as cherished among the F&B community and regular customers equally. Sporting the tagline “Your second home away from home,” talk to the regulars here, and you’ll know that they’re totally delivering on that promise.

Riyadh ice cream: Nine Soft Serve

Serving up soft serves that look like they were made for the ’gram, it’s hard not to notice this local brand with its in-your-face pink shining bright outside every one of its outlets. But, it isn’t just about the optics here – Nine Soft Serve has substance along with style, plus, history. The concept has been dishing up refreshing options since the ’90s.

If you haven’t tried the saffron gelato or fresh-flavoured camel milk with lavender or cardamom, just what are

you waiting for?

Co-founded by serial foodpreneur Abdulrahman Alazzam in 2020, RAW.K draws on its founder’s tech background to deliver healthy food straight from its in-house RAW.K Robot. There are few restaurants with robotic servers and even fewer health food restaurants with robots dishing food up. In 2023, RAW.K also launched a food truck to deliver your cold-pressed juices and salads in 15 minutes or less – in Riyadh traffic. That sets the bar for innovation high.

Robata is the new little sister from the brilliant team behind Myazu. The modern Japanese restaurant opened in 2023, and there has been a group of stylish diners filling tables since the brand launched. In fact, the new venue has pretty much made The Canopy complex a known area. Cristiano Ronaldo has also paid a visit, which says it all. Don’t leave without trying the wagyu gyoza followed by the cinnamon milk bun with cinnamon crunch ice cream, tamarind and palm sugar.

Section-B, Various locations

From being a hidden gem in Jeddah in 2013 to a burger empire spanning the country, Section-B’s story is nothing short of legendary. The home-grown burger bar is the creation of six young Saudis: Mansour, Fahad, Mohammed, Mostafa, Faisal and Baraa, who bonded over the quest to create the perfect burger. They claim to have spent a solid nine months perfecting the patty recipe, and given Section-B’s meteoric rise and continued success, we say it was certainly a success. Beef, chicken, or both, the important thing is to order then chow down.

So Matcha, Riyadh

So Matcha deserves so much credit for introducing matcha to this part of the world. Opening its doors in 2021, So Matcha founded by Yara Alnamlah was actually years in the making. Alnamlah put everything into creating a sustainable café that ticks all the boxes. As much as everyone loves their V60s, So Matcha is making people switch up their drink orders. (Yes, you can order coffee, too.) The stylish space with its pink walls and cosy vibe only adds to the appeal. The place has also transformed into a spot where you can stock up on all things matcha, from flavoured matcha powder and matcha-infused desserts to matcha kits. In 2023, the matcha trend skyrocketed – but So Matcha was doing things differently. The brand launched new exclusive drinks at new dining and shopping destination Via Riyadh. There were also collaborations with everyone from New Balance to Level Shoes to Maria Tash. The popular brand even went international with a pop-up in London as part of a Malone Souliers collaboration.

Takya, Riyadh

Cofounded by sisters Hadeel and Hissah Al Motawa and Nada Al Qasabi, this home-grown restaurant has celebrated Saudi fusion food since it launched in 2019. Imagine innovative twists on classics like kleija ice cream, zaatar and labneh cheesecake, falafel and tamees. Now in Bujairi Terrace, with UNESCO World Heritage Site Turaif just a stone’s throw away, dining here merges old and new aspects of Saudi culture along with a big focus on regional influences. The result is an informative and interesting dining experience every time. This is an easy-going eatery you will be returning to again and again. In 2023, Takya expanded with a tamees-focused café in Diriyah. This is Saudi food, but not as you know it. Takya is pushing what we think of Saudi cuisine forward while still celebrating tradition and regional characteristics. The brand strikes the balance brilliantly.

Date Published Last Updated 1 year ago 1 year ago Daniel Herszberg Daniel has visited Every Country in the World – the youngest Australian to set foot in all 197/197 countries!

Located on Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast, the city of Jeddah is often described as the ‘Gateway to Mecca’. The millions of Islamic pilgrims passing through Jeddah have transformed Jeddah into a world-class dining destination with a huge variety of international cuisines. Here are the 5 Top Restaurants in Jeddah for 2024.

Today, Jeddah boasts some of the best restaurants in Saudi Arabia. Whether you are spending the weekend in Jeddah, or about to travel from Jeddah to Al Ula, diving into the city’s dining scene is one of the top things to do in Jeddah!

the iconic wooden balconies of Jeddah’s Al Balad neighborhood.

In this article, I’ll be taking you on a culinary adventure through the best restaurants in Jeddah, beginning with Saudi cuisine, before we try some new cuisines – from Indonesia to Egypt!

1. Lazy Masoub

Any Top Restaurants in Jeddah list must start with Saudi cuisine.

One of the best ways to understand a country is through its cuisine. In my opinion, Lazy Masoub is one of the most Western-friendly restaurants to introduce you to Saudi cuisine. American and European travelers will feel comfortable in this trendy (and extremely Instagram-genic) little restaurant.

The legendary Masoub and Mutabbak of Lazy Masoub.

Lazy Masoub is one of the top restaurants in Jeddah for two Saudi foods you must try: Masoub and Mutabbak.

Masoub is my favourite breakfast dish in Saudi Arabia and a sweet highlight for a trip to Saudi Arabia. Hailing from the southern city of Abha (one of our top 10 beautiful places to visit in Saudi Arabia), Masoub is kind of like a British bread and butter pudding combined with a New York City banana pudding. All topped with a healthy drizzle of Saudi honey.

You can often find mutabbak being sold on the backstreets of Jeddah

Mutabbak is a flaky pastry stuffed with pretty much everything you could imagine: meat or chicken, vegetables or egg. I’m always on the look out for good vegetarian options and mutabbak was one of my favourite vegetarian foods in Saudi Arabia.

2. Khayal

With over 31,000 Google reviews, Khayal is a Jeddah food institution. I’m not sure I could even write a top restaurants in Jeddah list without mentioning Khayal.

The modern face of Saudi Arabia: Jeddah Corniche

If you want to act like you are living in Jeddah, take advantage of this 24-hour Lebanese restaurant for a late-night bite. Or like me, come for dinner and order one of everything.

Khayal would stand out even among the best restaurants of Amman or Beirut. Here, you can find the Middle Eastern cuisine that we know and love: smooth hummus, the full array of Lebanese salads and grilled meats.

Who can say no to a Middle Eastern feast?

For those craving alcohol in Jeddah, Khayal offer ‘Saudi cocktails’. This fun range of mocktails help create a ‘drink and dine’ ambience that can sometimes be lacking in Jeddah.

Local tip: You will almost always have to wait for a table at Khayal, so don’t arrive too hungry!

3. Leila Min Lebnen

Felafel, but make it bougie.

Leila min Lebnen offers a high-end Lebanese dining experience, with a lovely terrace to enjoy the sun during Jeddah’s ‘winter’. For ‘when to visit Saudi Arabia’, make sure you read our guide to everything you need to know before visiting Saudi Arabia!

My favorite Lebanese food: zaatar and cheese manouche (with a side of fresh hot pita and mutabbal).

One of my favourite things to eat in Beirut is manouche (or Lebanese pizza). In my opinion, the cheese and zaatar (zaatar wa jibne in Arabic) manouche from Leila min Lebnan hits the spot. After only one bite, you will quickly be transported to the streets of Lebanon. Leila min Lebnen know the perfect balance of cheese, zaatar and olive oil.

Always leave room for Saudi dessert. Less known, but no less delicious than the more famous desserts of Jordan and Syria.

4. Koshary Abu Tarek

If you only try one Egyptian dish in your life, it should be koshary. Layers of rice, pasta and lentils with a spiced tomato and garlic sauce, all topped off with a generous helping of fried onions.

Today, over 1.5 million Egyptians are working in Saudi Arabia. And where Egyptians go, Koshary follows.

If you have visited Cairo (or read any of our Cairo guides), you will know that Downtown Cairo‘s Abu Tarek is the best Cairo restaurant for koshary. And the only Abu Tarek outside of Cairo is here, in Jeddah!

Koshary is an entirely vegetarian dish, which makes Abu Tarek one of the best restaurants for vegetarians in Jeddah! Budget travelers will also be excited to know that Koshary Abu Tarek is one of the best cheap eats in Jeddah.

Local tip: At the time of writing, Abu Tarek is open until 2:00 am most days – making a bowl of koshary an ideal late night snack!

When visiting Cairo, you must try the quintessential Egyptian dish: Koshary

If koshary has you questioning everything you knew about Middle Eastern food, don’t miss our other favorite Egyptian dishes you must try!

5. Wong Solo

As the largest Muslim country in the world, millions of Indonesian migrants and pilgrims pass through Jeddah city every year. For those who haven’t yet traveled to Southeast Asia, or who are just craving a spicy plate of noodles – Wong Solo has you covered.

Crispy fried tofu at Wong Solo.

The menu here covers all the Indonesian classics from Nasi Goreng to spicy Rendangs. My personal favorite is the crispy fried tofu, which comes with all your favorite sambals.

Wong Solo is located right in front of Al-Balad, one of the most beautiful places to visit in Saudi Arabia. This makes Wong Solo an ideal lunch spot when exploring Jeddah!

F&B,"For 58 years between 1946 and 2004, journalist Alistair Cooke penned his ‘Letter from America’ on the BBC World Service. His reports covered milestone events such as Vietnam, the assassinations of JFK and Martin Luther King, Nixon’s exile, Reagan’s election and many more. Listening to Cooke as a young, impressionable Londoner, I was fascinated by his stories of a world that was so different to mine and the insights he shared with us.

Moving to live in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has prompted me to draw on Alistair Cooke for inspiration. Mine is a much more modest task, and I’m not a professional journalist but, I hope my ‘letters’ will provide some insight into the Kingdom’s changing restaurant scene as we play our modest part in shaping the restaurants of tomorrow.

The Kingdom is changing fast. For those of us who witnessed the changes that happened in Dubai and Abu Dhabi over the years, it is maybe easier to see the possibility of fundamental changes taking place in short timeframes. I recall running the numbers on the 20 times growth in the UAE branded casual dining sector in the 6 years leading up to 2010; showing that extraordinary change is possible with vision and will.

Plan 2030 produced by the Saudi Council of Economic and Development Affairs is one of those visions: comprehensive and inspiring, a plan to project the Kingdom into leading the world in many fields. It is a ‘bold yet achievable blueprint for an ambitious nation’.

Plan 2030 describes many aspects of everyday life in the Kingdom and how it will change in the next 10 years. The sections on the restaurant market are particularly striking with a vision for extensive growth in the number of restaurants and quality too, with aspirational targets set for the number of Michelin-standard restaurants.

If Plan 2030 is a blueprint for the future, then it is notable what has changed in recent years to set the foundation for this change. We are seeing new concepts pop up driven by Saudi entrepreneurs. Examples include Hamsa Wa Taghmisa and coffee concept 12Cups. Hamsa Wa Taghmisa in Riyadh is an excellent breakfast concept that has had queues out the door since it opened. In recent years, we at Keane have been lucky to be involved in a number of mixed-use developments across the Kingdom and we will be sharing our experiences on the Red Sea with you in future letters.

So, what will make the development of the Saudi dining scene different from the UAE and the rest of the Gulf? In essence, there are a comparatively low number of expats living in the Kingdom meaning that we, in the industry, have to be 100% aware of what Saudi nationals want from their future restaurant and café scene. This won’t be a cut and paste of international brands; the industry will have to create bespoke solutions to meet the aspirations of this fast-changing nation. Technology, sustainability, community engagement and entertainment will all play a part in meeting the needs of Saudi nationals; young, aspirational, ambitious and increasingly eager to try new food experiences and cuisines.

In the next post, I will be sharing with you the results of our research done in the Kingdom with a sample of 1000 respondents in collaboration with YouGov, which includes some striking data on Saudi eating out behaviour.

I hope you enjoyed this first letter and drop me a line on Stefan.Breg@keanebrands.com if you have any comments or want me to focus on any particular aspect of the Saudi restaurant scene.

"EDITION OPENS ITS 20TH OUTPOST IN JEDDAH, REFLECTING A NEW ERA FOR THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA","As Saudi Arabia sets its sights on creating a modern, thriving society through the goals outlined in its Vision 2030 roadmap, EDITION Hotels debuts in Jeddah, serving as a testament to this commitment of transformation. By capturing the vibrant spirit and unique character of Jeddah, EDITION Hotels is not just opening its first property in the region but introducing a category-defining concept that aligns seamlessly with the aspirations of the Kingdom’s manifesto for change.

The opening of The Jeddah EDITION on May 2, 2024, marks a pivotal moment; reflecting Saudi Arabia’s quest for economic and societal diversification, the property is a physical representation of the country’s pledge to empower its citizens and foster growth. Jeddah, with its rich history as the gateway to Mecca and a bustling hub of trade and culture, epitomizes the essence of “Jeddah Ghair” – a city that defies convention and embraces difference. In this dynamic metropolis, where tradition meets modernity, EDITION’s arrival signifies a new dawn.

As the world’s perception of Saudi Arabia evolves, The Jeddah EDITION stands as a symbol of the Kingdom’s journey towards a progressive future. With its multicultural ethos and innovative approach, this new addition to the EDITION family promises to redefine hospitality in the region, setting the stage for an era of growth and prosperity.

The unveiling of The Jeddah EDITION represents an exceptional collaboration between Marriott International, EDITION Hotels, and Yabu Pushelberg, uniting under the visionary leadership of Sela and its Managing Director, Dr. Rakan Al Harthi. The partnership epitomizes a delicate balance, merging Jeddah’s vibrant culture and rich traditions with the brand’s fervent spirit, sophistication, and passion for pushing boundaries. From this fusion emerges a singular entity, transcending the sum of its parts to seamlessly blend the essence of the East with the innovation of the West, creating an unparalleled hospitality experience.

Josh Fluhr, EDITION’s Senior Vice President and Global Managing Director, comments, “In this transformative time in the country’s rich history, we’re thrilled to further expand the EDITION brand in Saudi Arabia. Through our inspired partnership with Dr. Rakan Al Harthi and his team, we’re bringing EDITION’s unique concept to Jeddah, which is destined to evolve the luxury standard in the Kingdom.”

The Jeddah EDITION boosts Saudi Arabia’s exciting journey of transformation where refined sophistication, style and a new era of quiet luxury collide. Located on the Jeddah Corniche – a 30km coastal resort area along the Red Sea – the urban resort is steps from the Jeddah Art Promenade, and a short drive from destinations like Al-Balad, a UNESCO Heritage site in the historic part of the city, and The Red Sea Mall. Perched atop one of the most exciting corners of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix Circuit – the fastest Formula 1 track – adjacent to the Jeddah Yacht Club and Marina, the hotel settles neatly into its location within a sleek low-rise building designed to resemble a superyacht. As night falls, the Marina transforms into a destination of hospitality where locals enjoy late evenings of dining and shopping along the waterside.

Amid an oasis of landscaped gardens interspersed with eight-metre-tall palm trees, the property is creatively programmed and concepted by EDITION, and unfolds like a four-story theatrical piece. Designed in partnership between EDITION and international design studio Yabu Pushelberg, the hotel remains firmly rooted in the EDITION brand’s strong sense of refined simplicity and style. The property showcases 52 rooms and 11 suites including two Penthouses, a rooftop terrace with a pool, spa, gym, as well as two lounges and a signature restaurant with meticulously curated culinary concepts by acclaimed New York chef, Cédric Vongerichten.

As with all EDITION properties, the Lobby areas serve as the hotel’s lively beating heart, enveloping guests with the property’s signature scent upon entry into the open-flow lobby. Beneath soaring 12-metre-high ceilings, a large orange acrylic sphere by artist Vincent Leroy takes centre stage. Inspired by Jeddah’s famous sunrises and sunsets, the morning light radiates through the installation, dispersing a warm spherical glow onto clean-lined, custom-brushed white oak walls and travertine floors. The reception area – anchored by a walnut panelled niche and sculptural solid walnut desk – is met with upholstered wingback chairs intimately grouped with a prized Iranian silk Persian rug as well as Christian Liaigre console and lighting. The ground floor elevator lobby creates a picturesque moment of its own, boasting a molded and oxidized tinted glass mirror by artist Christopher Gaignon.

Adjacent to the lobby is the light-filled Lobby Lounge, which seamlessly flows from one convivial space to the next. Flanked by two large-scale golden acrylic wooden panel paintings by New York City-based artist John Jackson, the pieces reflect the evolving daylight, amplifying the golden yellow hues while paying homage to both Saudi Arabian culture and Jeddah’s unforgettable sunsets. In an elegant contrast, the space is dotted with curvilinear Molteni&C sofas, Henge tables, and white linen Avenue Road club chairs arranged around white marble coffee tables.

In the adjoining Lobby Bar, a black-and-white photography series by artist Richard Phibbs, an original royal purple billiard table by Blatt Billiards, and a custom gold leaf framed mirror above a Nero Marquina marble counter set the stage. Oak coffee tables and Christian Liaigre furniture in the warm and inviting space are layered with American black walnut wood flooring, plaster walls with moulding details, and full-height sheer white linen drapery. From day to night, the Lobby Bar will be the social nexus of the city, where guests will indulge in handcrafted beverages, coffee by a local roaster, and a selection of teas served alongside a menu of light bites and an incredible array of pastries. Outside, the expansive alfresco terrace, which spans the entirety of the building, provides a seamless flow of connection across the venues, with a bocce ball court, Red Sea vistas and views of the Floating Mosque.

Maritime, a name that reflects the spirit of culinary exploration, is the hotel’s signature contemporary French-Asian restaurant concepted by renowned chef Cédric Vongerichten. Recognized by Zagat as one of the top 30 chefs under 30, chef Cédric has honed his craft in some of the most celebrated kitchens around the world, including three-Michelin-starred El Bulli in Spain. His distinguished career at the most prestigious restaurants echoes his prolific chef and restaurateur father, Jean-Georges Vongerichten.

“Maritime is inspired by my love of Asian flavours, which began during my years living in Bangkok, in harmony with my passion for French cooking techniques. I’ve created a menu that reflects diverse cultures and features the aromatic spices of the region alongside the finest local ingredients” says chef Cédric Vongerichten.

Maritime, open from sunrise to late evening, serves perfectly executed dishes designed to be shared. Spice is at the forefront, adding depth, flavour and aroma while merging Asian and Arabian sensibilities. Explore exquisite culinary creations like local shrimp dumplings accompanied by lemongrass beurre blanc and caviar, complemented by innovative non-alcoholic beverages such as the Saffron Spritz, featuring ginger honey and fresh saffron to tantalize your taste buds. The space holds two private dining rooms and an open show-kitchen; the design mirrors the cultural abundance of the culinary offerings. The interior reveals curved light plum velvet banquettes, walnut dining tables, and Thonet chairs with natural caning. Rich details such as distressed glass mirrors, potted banana leaf plants, blue and white Chinese pottery, and a prized Iranian silk Persian rug beneath the communal dining table complete the lively space. Overlooking the Red Sea, the restaurant’s terrace is ensconced by potted plants and over 150-year-old olive trees, while pink bougainvillea-covered pergolas provide protection from the blazing sun as long lunches effortlessly flow into golden hour drinks and dreamy dinners.

Follow the oak-panelled corridor to a partition of teal blue velvet drapes leading to The Den, a secluded haven for cigar aficionados to unwind. Unique to the EDITION portfolio, the intimate, low-lit lounge is dressed in custom tufted teal blue velvet banquettes and outfitted with rich brown armchairs and stools. The walls are adorned with whimsical photographs by artist Christian Vieler encased in classical ornate frames that depict the unbridled joy of dogs catching treats, adding a quaint layer to the space. From the lacquered rosewood countertop, bespoke coffees and non-alcoholic beverages, such as The Den Sour, are best enjoyed with light bites from chef Cédric Vongerichten, followed by a hand rolled cigar underneath the stars on the private terrace, creating a dream escape for cigar lovers near and far.

Nestled between the hotel’s third and fourth floors lie the 52 rooms and 11 suites, making for the ultimate urban retreat. Rooms are an understated haven that spotlights the artistry and craftmanship of EDITION’s signature design approach, with travertine bathrooms seamlessly leading to bright, white oak spaces and terraces boasting vista views to take in either the Red Sea or the F1 track. Each room is masterfully designed to be a calming space. Layered with travertine flooring, white oiled oak wall panelling embellished with black-and-white photographs of old Jeddah, and custom furnishings such as the inset leather headboards, accommodations are a vision of muted luxury. Freestanding bathtubs and signature EDITION Le Labo toiletries complete the serene enclave.

The Penthouse and Royal Penthouse set The Jeddah EDITION apart, providing a truly indulgent experience like no other. Spread over 240 sqm, the two-bedroom Penthouse encompasses two ensuite bathrooms and features a bright, spacious living room with a Christophe Delcourt sofa, Nienkemper metal coffee table and Liaigre bronze armchair and side stools. The exquisite dining room includes a 10-seat white marble table, and an additional seating area is equipped with Liaigre black wood lounge chairs, white linen upholstery, and a Holly Hunt Tudor coffee table. An expansive and lushly landscaped wrap-around terrace overlooking the Red Sea, Jeddah Yacht Club, and Formula 1 racetrack features two separate lounge areas perfect for private dining. There is also direct access to a private staircase to the pool deck and The Roof.

At the other end of the property, also offering front-row seats to the Grand Prix as well as views of the Red Sea and revered Floating Mosque, Al Rahmah, sits the Royal Penthouse, a spectacular 600 sqm duplex set over the third and fourth floors. Curated to cater to your every need, the Royal Penthouse features an elegantly landscaped terrace with an eating area and arrangement of living spaces along with private elevator access, an in-suite pantry, and a lower-level room for private security. Bright interiors unfurl to include a casual and formal sitting room, dining room, and two bedrooms with their own living rooms, extensive walk-in wardrobes, indulgent bathrooms, and blissful views of the Red Sea. In true EDITION fashion, the Penthouses are elegant and refined in neutral tones elevated with curated artwork and furnishings by Christophe Delcourt and Christian Liaigre. Floor-to-ceiling shelves with l’objets d’art and an array of books covering everything from fashion to architecture and art polish the space, giving a residential feel.

On the fourth floor, The Roof is a dreamy Mediterranean beach club-inspired escape. Perfect for locals and travellers alike, it features a series of private nooks and lounges ensconced by greenery against panoramic views of the vibrant Marina, Jeddah Yacht Club and F1 track. A sleek 14-metre pool is lined with sunbeds, bougainvillea-shaded cabanas, and dotted with Mediterranean-style potted plants. The menu features a variety of wood-fire cooked a la carte and sharing dishes, such as the grilled octopus served with fingerling potatoes topped with labneh, to be enjoyed after a day spent drinking frozen pressed juices or iced frappés poolside. The fourth floor is also home to a gym and The Spa where its warm walnut panelling and soft lighting beckons. An intimate and lowkey space with three treatment rooms – each with its own changing areas – the entrance is decorated with paintings by Copenhagen-based Anne Nowak while the menu comprises everything from facials to massages, using Natura Bissé products from Barcelona.

As The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia enters a progressive new era, The Jeddah EDITION is a one-of-a-kind hotel supporting Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 and putting one of the country’s most exciting cities on the map.

A travel guide to AlUla,"A destination that’s become synonymous with the kingdom’s bucket-list sights, prepare to be stunned by the sights and sounds of this unspoiled natural beauty…

About AlUla

AlUla’s significance as a crossroads of ancient civilisations dates back thousands of years. While it’s largely remained off-limits to the public, that changed in 2020 when AlUla opened some of its sights to visitors for the first time. Since then, the historic town of AlUla, located 1,040 kilometres northwest of Riyadh, has been transforming into an incredible open-air museum – building on its storied past to carve a future filled with resorts and glamping retreats carved into the desert landscape, restaurant pop-ups aplenty and festivals that celebrate the rich history, art and culture of the region.

Here’s the What’s On travel guide to AlUla.

Where to stay

Habitas AlUla

For only its third property in the world, boutique eco-retreat Habitas made roots in the Ashar Valley of AlUla. Complete with 96 villas dotted across the vast desert landscape, rooms are set between manmade dunes for optimum privacy, and many feature epic mountain views from their private terraces. The best way to get around is on an electric bike, and there’s something truly freeing about whizzing through the valley that way (although there’s buggies too for those looking to give their legs a rest). The main restaurant Tama, which means ‘here and now’, is designed as a space for bringing guests together, with big lounge spaces and lots of long tables for dining in big groups. On the menu, nourishing dishes are globally influenced with a strong Middle Eastern presence, and ingredients sourced from local farms take centre stage. There’s a separate, open-air seating space, which leads out to a shimmering infinity pool: it’s the perfect spot to dip between the water and the relaxing ambience of the lounge. Habitas started as a community-focused series of events, so it makes sense that there’s plenty of other gathering spaces too, including the glass-lined reception, Moon Shell coffee lounge, and an open-air space for breathing workshops and meditation. Installations originally commissioned for the first Desert X AlUla are also shaped into the resort offering, allowing guests to ignite their inner child with a giant swing set backdropped by huge rock formations and trampolines hidden in the desert sands.

ourhabitas.com

Caravan by Habitas

Looking to really connect with the otherworldly AlUla landscape? Habitas has added a new string to its bow in the kingdom, which promises a glamping experience – but not as you know it. Caravan by Habitas is located a five-minute drive from the Habitas resort, so glampers checking-in benefit from all of the perks of the resort including Tama restaurant, access to the infinity pool and fitness and wellness spaces. Rather than Bedouin-inspired tents, accommodation here is in the form of retro Airstream trailers tucked into the AlUla valley. Each is fitted with cosy twin or neat double beds and has its own kitchenette, dining space and separate shower and toilet, making it a comfortable and well equipped base to serve as your AlUla starting point. It’s been given the Habitas treatment with a day bed fitted under a shaded terrace and soft furnishings in aztec prints scattered throughout. There’s separate facilities for Caravan by Habitas guests too, including the new Gathering Tent, where guests can connect over games under the shaded tent, an open-air cinema beaming films onto a rock face, and a duo of vintage food trucks where guests gather for fresh croissants at breakfast or pizzas in the afternoon.

ourhabitas.com

Coming soon: Banyan Tree AlUla

In 2022, AlUla’s hotel development continues with the introduction of Banyan Tree AlUla in the second half of the year, which will rebrand and extend the current Ashar Resort, close to the UNESCO-listed site of Hegra. Inspired by more than 200,000 years of human heritage, the resort features a collection of one-, two-, and three-bedroom pool villas, each blending an elegant look and feel with the natural elements.

Where to eat

Circolo

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Circolo Pizza (@circolo.pizza)

On the rustic outskirts of AlJadidah, a serene oasis surrounds Circolo, an Italian restaurant that serves as the perfect spot for a long, lazy lunch. Twirling ribbons of al dente linguine are served in a sauce of wild mushrooms and truffle oil, or order one of the artisan pizzas, with a perfectly crisp base and topped with flavours such as pesto burrata; eggplant, caramelised onion and bacon; or pulled lamb.

@circolo.pizza

Okto

View this post on Instagram A post shared by OKTO (@okto.sa)

Bringing the sandy beaches of Greece to an AlUla mountain top by way of Riyadh, Okto brings contemporary Greek cuisine to one of the best vantage spots in AlUla: Harrat Viewing Point. The restaurant – painted all-black – blends into the moody slate colours of the mountain peaks, and guests gather around tables that dot a central bar, with woolly ponchos on hand to keep guests warm when the temperature dips. On the menu, slithers of deep-fried halloumi, lamb chops marinated with kalamata olives and crispy chicken gyro’s are among our favourite dishes.

@okto.sa

Maraya Social

The vast AlUla desert might not be a predictable choice for a Michelin-pedigree chef, but that’s where you’ll find Jason Atherton’s Maraya Social. A European brasserie housed on the rooftop of the mezmerising Maraya Hall, Maraya Social is the British chef’s first restaurant in Saudi Arabia. Inside, the leafy green restaurant is beautifully botanical, while outside, a terrace lit with flickering candles and the rocky façade creating a dramatic backdrop.

marayasocial.com

Merkaz

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Merkaz_KSA (@merkaz_ksa)

Looking to tick “eat like a local” off your AlUla bucket list? In the heart of AlUla Old Town, make a pit-stop at Merkaz, a casual café serving traditional Arabian dishes in a setting peppered with outdoor pergolas, palm trees and fairy lights. Settle into one of the plush sofas and don’t leave without a piping hot pot of karak.

@merkaz_ksa

SALT

The region’s cult burger brand has expanded from the cities and you’ll now find SALT’s signature silver airstream trailer under the iconic silhouette of Jabal AlFil (Elephant Rock). Juicy burgers, moreish sliders and perfectly salted fries are the familiar favourites here, as well as SALT’s sweet-tooth-satisfying soft serve.

@findsalt

The to-do list

Pay a visit to AlJadidah, where old meets new

The latest addition to AlUla’s growing number of attractions is AlJadidah, which has been transformed into a pedestrianised hub for art, culture and dining. It’s easy to walk around the entire of AlJadidah, which means ‘new town’ in Arabic, which has been cleverly divided around five separate squares. Overlooking AlUla Old Town, highlights include Oasis Square, where live musicians entertain those that gather under the dappled shade of chairs and benches set under palm trees; Moayadah Square, with its array of street food vendors and food trucks; and Art Square, home to Cinema Al Housh, AlUla’s first arthouse cinema, showing an array of English and Arabic independents.

Check out the dazzling Maraya Hall

A Guinness World Record-breaking venue, AlUla’s Maraya Hall is an architectural feat, and officially recognised as the world’s largest mirror clad building. The 500-seater concert hall has already played host to stars including Enrique Iglesias, Alicia Keys, Lionel Richie and Andrea Bocelli, and those who visit AlUla during the winter season (October to March) can expect a similar calibre of star to be performing most weekends. Feeling hungry? Jason Atherton’s Maraya Social is housed on the rooftop. Looking for some more culture? Until March 20, step inside the private art collection of Saudi-based collector and patron Basma AlSulaiman in a curated exhibit at Maraya.

Immerse yourself in an open-air exhibition

A collaboration between the Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) and California-born Desert X, Desert X AlUla is the living art exhibition you need to see in 2022. Running until March 30 and free to enter, this year’s theme is Sarab, which means “mirage” in Arabic. Laced through a series of spectacular canyons in Al-Mutadil valley, 15 regional and international artists have curated pieces for Desert X AlUla, each inspired by “mirage” and “oasis” and their eternal links to the desert landscape. Don’t miss Alicja Kwade’s photo-friendly series of frames and mirrors that reflect and frame the natural artefacts on the desert floor, and the subjects that face them.

Take a tour of Saudi Arabia’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site in a vintage Land Rover

Hegra was the first site in Saudi Arabia to be inscribed onto the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2008 (a further five have since been added). There’s a collection of 110 tombs to discover, that date back some 2,500 years. Some tombs are better preserved than others, but decoration and inscriptions are all discoverable with the naked eye. The best way to maximise your trip is with a local Rawi as your guide in a vintage Land Rover, which stops at five key sights over a two-hour tour including the most famous Tomb of Lihyan Son of Kuza and Hegra’s highest point, Jabal Ithlib.

Watch the sun set at Jabal AlFil (Elephant Rock)

There are a whole host of sunset spots across AlUla – this is a town that looks good from every angle, but Jabal AlFil – commonly known as Elephant Rock – is one of the best places in AlUla to watch the day turn to night. In front of the looming Jabal AlFil, given its moniker thanks to its size and shape, is an array of sunken seating carved into the sand, plus bea bags and benches, giving visitors a front row seat to watch the sun dip behind the famous geological formation. It’s free to enter, and there’s now even a SALT food truck located within the grounds, alongside a coffee shop.

The food and drink scene in Makkah and Madinah Saudi Arabia,"Madinah

Near the Haram

Unlike Makkah, there aren’t any typical malls near the Masjid. So, on the face of it in terms of conveniency, the food scene near Masjid an-Nabawi is not as good as Masjid al-Haram in Makkah. We’ll summarise the main options here. A quick stroll around the exterior of the Masjid and around the hotels, you’ll slowly start to notice many “two hole in the wall shops” – I call them two hole because they literally have two holes. One hole serving shawarma, sandwiches and the like and the other hole serving beverages hot and cold. We had food from some of them, but in all honesty wasn’t too impressed. The queues were mad as this is the closest to the mosque and everyone would come straight after prayer. The prices were unreasonable I thought for the quality. And the quality was dire. The shawarma in particular were dry and really not worth the wait and struggle of ordering.

Al Faris Restaurant is a super popular spot amongst visitors. This is evident as soon as you step foot into the restaurant. It’s located very close to the mosque and offers humble and reasonably priced food. Think Pakistani, Afghan and Bukhari food. Very good for dine in (family room available) or takeaway (close to all the hotels). My personal favourite thing to get from here is the chargrilled chicken with Bukhari rice.

There is an area right behind the Masjid, which is known as the Bengali Market. Here you’ll find a few streets full of elite level authentic Bengali food. They cover breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the food is seriously good. Easy to get to too if your hotel is located at the back end of the Masjid.

Hardees & KFC vs McDonald’s seems to be the battle in terms of western fast food chains. Due to a lack of a mall, the small Hardees and KFC hole in the wall spot right at the back of the Masjid is super super popular. There’s always mad queues here. However, it seems not many know about the McDonald’s, which is great if you can’t be asked to queue up for ages.

There’s this new initiative where there are some small stalls behind Masjid an-Nabawi (adjacent to King Fahd gate I think – right where the hotels are and where everyone chills). There’s a row of little shops on two sides. These little shops sell all sorts – gifts, souvenirs, books, grocery, food and drink. Definitely could do with more food shops though. We found a few good shops – high quality ice cream, fresh pomegranate juice and one selling Baleela (traditional chick pea dish), also someone on my TikTok mentioned that there is one shop that sells Ajwa ice cream! There’s seating down the middle for people to sit and chill, but overall, there aren’t many eating options here, but I do like the concept. There’s a speciality coffee cafe at the end of these little shops too that looks worth trying.

I prefer getting my hotel at the back end of the Masjid as it seems to be the more lively end, so all the above options are for the back end. If you are at the front end, you may have more options including the famous and big Al Baik branch that attracts notoriously large crowds. Notoriously large! Think black stone crowds and that’s no exaggeration. There must be more options there too, but I’m not too familiar with that side of the Masjid."
5 exciting restaurants are coming to The St. Regis Red Sea,"The restaurants range from an Arabic sharing spot to Japanese izakaya.

The Red Sea Project is one of the most exciting megaprojects in Saudi Arabia. Epic in scale, it will be home to luxurious hotels, which include The St. Regis Red Sea Resort. Ahead of its opening, the property has unveiled its exciting food and beverage offerings.

The St. Regis Red Sea Resort is located on the Ummahat Islands archipelago, which can be accessed by a chartered boat or seaplane. The resort marks the brand’s introduction into the kingdom, and it brings Maldives-like glamour to Saudi Arabia. Not only are the rooms stunning, but also the restaurants.

The Red Sea Project is expected to cover 28,000 kilometres of islands, beaches, deserts, mountains and even volcanos and be a leading destination for eco-luxury. The plan is to have no waste-to-landfill or single-use plastic, and be 100 per cent carbon neutral. Plus, The Red Sea International Airport is in the works, so you can soon land in the megaproject.

Nesma

The St. Regis Red Sea will be home to five restaurants. Nesma serves Middle Eastern cuisine, which is designed for sharing. Nesma means light in Arabic, and the venue will be a breezy spot with an island backdrop. Open for breakfast and lunch, there will be beautiful breakfast displays, an a la carte menu, tea masters and a live cooking station. Plus, the concept draws inspiration from its location and will include local music, entertainment and even ingredients.

Gishiki 45

The Japanese restaurant Gishiki 45 will be open for dinner, and boasts local fish and seafood. With 80 seats, the refined space draws its inspiration from modern izakaya venues, and it will include live music as well as entertainment. Gishiki means ritual in Japanese, and we are expecting a tableside service and Insta-worthy plating. Plus, the drinks menu will include Japanese-inspired mocktails.

Tilinia

The rooftop restaurant Tilinia is set in a spectacular space. The name is a nod to the Tellina shell, and the walls boast a beautiful shell-like pattern. Located above the reef, it offers panoramic views beyond the island. Open for dinner, the fine dining menu specialises in grilled meats and includes imported meats as well as locally grown ingredients. Plus, there is a dedicated bar offering low ball mocktails and live music.

The Beach Club

The Beach Club is all about casual, comfort food. The informal lounge is located on the beach, and guests can feel the sand between their toes. The food covers international as well as grilled dishes. The drinks cover iced mocktails, milkshakes and healthy slushies. Plus, the venue boasts a relaxed vibe – watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen, and enjoy the house lounge music soundtrack.

The St. Regis Bar

The St. Regis Red Sea would not be complete without the brand’s signature bar, The St. Regis Bar. Not only does every St. Regis in the world have the bar, but each one serves its own interpretation of The Bloody Mary. St. Regis New York lays claim to inventing The Bloody Mary, so, we are expecting a non-alcoholic version of that drink to come to the Red Sea. Plus, there will be sunset tea rituals, and tea and coffee masters.

How the Red Sea Project aims to showcase Saudi Arabia’s culinary heritage,"DUBAI: The national cuisines of few countries can boast the variety of influences found in Saudi Arabian dishes, thanks to the remarkable assortment of flavors and ingredients introduced to the Kingdom over centuries by pilgrims, merchants and travelers.

The variety of traditional dishes that can be found across the country reflect these diverse cultural influences — from the likes of India, North and East Africa, South and Central Asia and the Levant — that enriched and seasoned the Kingdom’s traditions.

Now, Saudi chefs and the hospitality sector are once again using food to help build bridges between nations and cultures. One of the organizations that is embracing this art of “culinary diplomacy” is The Red Sea Development Company, which is managing the new tourism megaproject taking shape along the Kingdom’s Red Sea coast.







TRSDC CEO John Pagano with a group of Saudi hospitality students. (Supplied)



In line with the aims of Saudi Vision 2030, the nation’s strategy for economic diversification, TRSDC is working to stimulate new industries, create jobs, encourage entrepreneurism, and drive growth in the tourism, leisure and hospitality sectors.

“At the moment our focus is to bring young Saudis into the hospitality industry,” Lars Eltvik, the company’s senior education adviser, told Arab News.

“This is a new industry to the Kingdom and there has been a very limited offering of hospitality and culinary education in the country before. It is not dissimilar to what used to be the case in Dubai, 20 years ago.”

The Red Sea Project is a plan for a sustainable tourism resort covering about 28,000 square kilometers along Saudi Arabia’s western coast, including more than 90 unspoiled islands. The 50 hotels and 1,300 residential properties that will be built there will be served by some of the Kingdom’s top restaurants, according to Eltvik.

“We want to be able to attract, document and develop food from all the regions of Saudi Arabia so that it can then be presented in luxury hotels across the Red Sea Project,” he said.







TRSDC is building partnerships with institutions across the Kingdom that were founded to preserve and promote Saudi cuisine. (Supplied/TRSDC)



Eltvik has worked in the hospitality sector and hospitality education for three decades. Between 2001 and 2009 he was based in Dubai, where he worked at the Emirates Academy of Hospitality Management.

He hopes that the success the sector has enjoyed in the UAE’s commercial capital can be replicated in Saudi Arabia on a shorter timescale and in a way that is more faithful to the nation’s cultural sensitivities.

“In Saudi Arabia, everything is on the fast track now,” said Eltvik. “We are working to achieve the same (as we achieved in Dubai), and more, but in a very compressed time frame. At TRSDC, we are looking to get on board tens of thousands of staff, with a strong focus on hospitality and, within the hospitality sector, a focus on the culinary arts.”







Saudi chefs and the hospitality sector are once again using food to help build bridges between nations and cultures. (Supplied/ZADK)



The company is working to promote the hospitality industry as a desirable career option for young Saudis, he said, in keeping with the government’s Saudization drive. To that end, education authorities in the Kingdom have implemented a number of programs in which TRSDC will sponsor trainees that will eventually fill essential roles in the sector, he added.

“We are focusing on the authenticity of enhancing tourism and hospitality through food in the Kingdom, and through the projection and education of young Saudis to proudly present their history and their past through the culinary experience,” Eltvik said.

There is a consensus that simply replicating the type of restaurants and cuisines that can be found in cities around the globe will not help to transform Saudi Arabia into the distinctive culinary destination that is envisioned. A focus on promoting the culinary arts and distinctly Saudi flavors are therefore clear priorities.

FAST FACTS • The Red Sea Project is a 28,000 sq km sustainable-tourism resort due for completion by 2030. • The Red Sea Development Company is expected to contribute $5.3 billion to national gross domestic product

While many traditional local dishes are common across the country — such as kabsa, which is made from rice, meat, vegetables and spices, and harees, an Arabian favorite comprised of ground wheat, meat and spices — the flavors, ingredients and cooking techniques can vary widely from one region to another.

The Red Sea port city of Jeddah has long attracted travelers from the region and the world, resulting in dishes replete with Persian, Levantine, Turkish, Maghrebi, and Central and South Asian influences.

In Hijaz, for example, the influences for popular dishes such as bukhari rice, manto (dumplings filled with beef and onion), shish barak (meat dumplings cooked in a yogurt-based stew), and kabli rice can be traced to Central and East Asia, while the origins of the vegetable-based stews that are popular in the region lie in North Africa and the Levant.

In the Kingdom’s central Najd plateau, meanwhile, the local cuisine includes heavier dishes such as soups, stews and sauces that better suit the area’s cooler climate.







“I created ZADK because I saw that in Saudi Arabia we were lacking an academy to learn about our cultural cuisine,” Rania Moualla said. (Supplied/ZADK)



In March, TRSDC appointed Lawrence Assadourian its culinary director with a mandate to work with Saudi chefs to create unique food options for regional and international visitors to enjoy, while also promoting local favorites.

“One of our missions is community development,” he told Arab News. “How are we, as a group, going to ensure that the Red Sea has a sense of place? (That) it is not just an experience replica of another destination in the world?

“And one of the ways we are looking to do that is to build the necessary programs that will incubate and accelerate Saudi-based chefs. We feel this is important because, long-term, the sustainability of talent should be driven by local people, to complement foreign talent.”

Sustainability is at the heart of what TRSDC is hoping to achieve as the Kingdom’s nascent tourism, leisure and hospitality industries set out to create offerings that are sensitive to local customs and in keeping with the environment.

“We are a regenerative tourism destination,” Assadourian said. “We care deeply about the environment and the integration of the communities in which we are building our projects.

“We need to ensure that we strike a strong balance between internationally experienced cuisine in our destination and how we infuse the culinary and cultural heritage of Saudi Arabia into the entire guest-experience journey.”







While many traditional local dishes are common across the country, the flavors, ingredients and cooking techniques can vary widely from one region to another. (Supplied/ZADK)



To achieve this, TRSDC is building partnerships with institutions across the Kingdom that were founded to preserve and promote Saudi cuisine.

Among those who welcome TRSDC’s mission to serve up the Kingdom’s culinary traditions to the world is Moe Inani, executive chef and co-owner of Chifty, a stylish restaurant and cosmopolitan lounge in Riyadh.

Although he is an engineer by training, Inani said his first love was cooking, a skill he picked up at an early age while helping his mother prepare meals at the family’s home in his native Jeddah.

After concluding his studies in the US, Inani became a sous-chef at Saison, a Michelin-starred restaurant in San Francisco where he learned to prepare sushi, and later for upmarket restaurants Nobu and Morimoto.

With his background in Japanese cuisine, Inani has created some novel twists on the more conventional local takes on Red Sea fish, and Arab News has learned that discussions are under way for him to collaborate with TRSDC.







“We want to be able to attract, document and develop food from all the regions of Saudi Arabia,” Lars Eltvik, senior education adviser with the Red Sea Development Company. (Supplied)



“Food has always united us,” Rania Moualla, a Saudi philanthropist and the founder and chair of ZADK, a nonprofit culinary academy in Al-Khobar in the Eastern Province, told Arab News.

The academy was founded in 2018, three years after Moualla published her cookbook, “A Spoonful of Home.” Its mission to nurture Saudi Arabia’s rich culinary heritage by empowering local chefs is similar to that of TRSDC, with which it has formed a partnership.

“I created ZADK because I saw that in Saudi Arabia we were lacking an academy to learn about our cultural cuisine,” Moualla said. “Most of our restaurants are in the hands of expats. I launched ZADK because I wanted to do something sustainable and with a higher impact for the community.”

She said the academy is looking at ways in which it can develop its partnership with TRSDC by helping to train the next generation of Saudi chefs.

“I am looking forward to having their students study at our academy,” Moualla said.







The Red Sea Project is a 28,000 sq km sustainable-tourism resort due for completion by 2030. (Supplied/TRSDC)



In so doing, ZADK, which also has a separate partnership agreement with Culinary Arts Academy Switzerland, aims to promote the Saudi gastronomical scene and ensure it meets international standards.

“Our mission is to develop the best culinary school in Saudi Arabia, make it a platform for social change and teach our cuisine in a way that enables students to learn international cuisines as well as Saudi cuisines,” Moualla said.

What was once a city of simple shawarma joints and kabsa spots has reinvented itself into one of the most exciting culinary capitals in the Middle East — a playground for celebrity chefs, global fine-dining heavyweights and homegrown culinary trailblazers alike.

With the long-awaited metro system unlocking new pockets of the city, and Riyadh Season bringing dozens of exciting pop-ups, there’s never been a better time to eat out in the Saudi capital. Here are the best restaurants to check out in Riyadh this year.

Al Mamlaka Social Dining brings well-loved brands together under one roof Courtesy Al Mamlaka Social Dining

Al Mamlaka Social Dining

Struggling to pick between Riyadh’s restaurants? Al Mamlaka Social Dining solves that dilemma by bringing almost two dozen of the city’s best under one roof. Tucked beneath Olaya’s Kingdom Centre, this green-hued food hall – anchored by a bar shaking up non-alcoholic cocktails – is a smorgasbord of coffee shops, desert stops and street food spots, including scaled-down outposts of Easy Bakery (don’t miss those swirly chocolate croissant wheels), Nozomi, Overjar, Burger Boutique and Hanoverian. For something heavier, head to the sit-down spots: the first Middle East branch of El Ta’koy slings flavour-packed Hawaiian bowls and bao buns, while Assembly by Chef Tommy – of Beirut’s beloved Baron – elevates traditional Lebanese-Armenian shish skewers with contemporary twists (splurge $27 for a stick of meat and an hour of unlimited mezze). The queues can be long on weekends when the food hall is open until 3am, but it’s a feast that’s well worth waiting for.

Address: Kingdom Centre, Olaya St, Al Olaya

Al Orjouan

Forget everything you think you know about hotel buffets at The Ritz-Carlton’s Al Orjouan, which lays out a feast fit for a king in the grand halls of a former royal palace. The variety of dishes is dazzling, from mini cocottes of scrambled eggs with rich truffle oil at breakfast to authentic ful medames served throughout the day, plus a curated selection of dates including the finest local and international varieties. An Arabian-inspired beverage menu features the Desert Rose – combining pomegranate syrup, rose water and honey – and the Green 600, an inventive mix of green apple, cucumber, spinach juice and an olive syrup “ice cube” that celebrates the ancient olive tree in the hotel’s grand courtyard.

Address: The Ritz-Carlton, Riyadh, Al Hada

Attaché

In a former horse stable on the edge of Riyadh’s walled-in Diplomatic Quarter, this hush-hush member’s club from the team behind MDLBEAST sees foreign officials rubbing shoulders over a multicultural menu that’s equal parts style and substance. Dining reservations are open to all, with winning dishes like twice-baked Swiss comte souffle, locally caught sea bass and a glistening strawberry dome – revealed beneath a cloud of candy floss with a blowtorch – crowning the indoor-to-outdoor space. As the night rolls on, the party spills into Unstable, the restaurant’s clubby alter ego next door. Moody low ceilings and edgy beats keep the after-hours crowd going until late, although in keeping with the diplomatic theme, you’ll need to apply for a “visa” online first to get inside."

Best Time to Visit Riyadh

Locals will say that the best time to visit Riyadh is during Winter because people are out of their homes and there are more events on during the winter because of the cooler temperature. However, in terms of the weather in Riyadh, do not think that Saudi Arabia and Riyadh is hot all year round. I was pretty cold for most of my time in Riyadh in January and it was a little warmer in February. It was pleasant though, just pack a coat and layers.

The Summer in Riyadh heats up and is unbearably hot with temperatures rising well over 40c so it is not advisable to visit Riyadh in the Summer.

Spring and Autumn are good times of year to visit Riyadh because it’s warm but not yet the summer temperatures.

When visiting Riyadh and all of Saudi Arabia, be sure to take into account when Ramadan is as everything is pretty much shut during this time.

This is the part that makes Riyadh hard to visit as a tourist and traveller because getting around Riyadh is not easy, or cheap, and Riyadh is most definitely not pedestrian-friendly!

There is no public transport in Riyadh. Right now, they are building the Riyadh Metro but who knows when it will open and be fully sufficient.

Uber and Careem taxi apps are available in Riyadh and although they are not really cheap and you often have to wait up to 10 minutes for a car, they are the best way to travel around Riyadh and they are not too expensive.

As a tourist to Riyadh, in this Riyadh travel guide, I wouldn’t suggest hiring a car to drive in the city. The roads in Riyadh and the traffic, are both pretty crazy so you would need to be a very confident driver and have experience driving in the Middle East and/or Asia before.

If you are, then go for it and check out Rental Cars to get a quote for your Riyadh car hire!

As you can see, Riyadh is huge!

Where to Stay in Riyadh

Finding good accommodation in Riyadh, in my opinion, is hard if you do not have a huge budget but I will give you some good options below in this Riyadh travel guide.

In regards to the best location to stay in Riyadh, Olaya is the main city centre with plenty of accommodation and it is central, however, in Riyadh, like many cities, you are always going to be far from something as you need to drive to get to every part of the city so it doesn’t matter too much where you stay.

Locals say that staying in the North of the city is better as generally, parts of the South of the city are older and poorer and as a tourist, you will probably feel more comfortable in the North and Centre.

Hotels in Riyadh

There are plenty of Hotels in Riyadh and I find Booking.com to be a good place to look. Prices of accommodation in Riyadh are high and if you go for the cheaper options, they will be very budget places and not that nice so keep this in mind.

I have stayed in Obaer Hotel which I recommend as one of the best hotels in Riyadh for being clean, in a good location and a reasonable price. I would stay there again and I do recommend it to you.

You can search for availability and prices at Obaer Hotel here on Booking.com!

I have also stayed in Bazil Hotel Suites, it wasn’t that bad and the location is good but I wouldn’t stay there again as it wasn’t very good in quality for the price.

The main thing to note when booking hotels in Riyadh is that the scores on Booking.com, for example, are very low. I never book hotels that are a 7 rating or less, but it turns out Saudi’s are very critical when it comes to reviews so most hotels are less than 8. Try not to let that put you off too much and go for the highest you can.

For high-end hotels that will not disappoint you in Riyadh then look into:

Marriott Riyadh Diplomatic Quarter

Narcissus Hotel and SPA Riyadh

Voyage Hotel

Aswar Hotel Suites Riyadh

Four Seasons Hotel Riyadh

You can search for more hotels in Riyadh on Booking.com here!

My room at the Obaer Hotel in Riyadh.

Hostels in Riyadh

At the moment there is just 1 hostel in Riyadh, it is a Hi Hostel with 3 bed shared gender dorm rooms only and I have a feeling this might be more popular for Saudis or workers in Riyadh so I would recommend you check the reviews before booking.

There is no hostel culture in Riyadh or Saudi Arabia yet to make backpacking Saudi Arabia easier but I hope that changes. I’ll keep this post updated!

Couch surfing in Riyadh

I had never couch surfed before visiting Saudi Arabia but I know that so many people do and have great experiences from it. Without a doubt, my trips to Riyadh were so much better because between a few nights in a hotel, I also couch surfed with 2 local Saudi hosts so I really want to include this option in my Riyadh city guide.

This is how I got to see and hear about Riyadh in a local way meeting their friends and family, being welcomed into homes with Arabic Coffee and driving around the city at past midnight because that’s just what Saudi’s do!

I do recommend looking on Couchsurfing to help you find good accommodation in Riyadh and yes, as a solo female traveller in Riyadh, I did feel very safe with my 2 hosts, one of which was male and the other female, just be sure to read the reviews of your host first.

Things to do in Riyadh

There are 2 ways to see Riyadh – as a tourist and as a local.

Whilst there are a few good tourist attractions in Riyadh, Riyadh is not like many other cities around the world where there are lots of lots of places to visit and tick off on your Riyadh sightseeing list, that’s why I wanted to write this Riyadh travel guide to help you work out what to do in Riyadh!

Popular tourist attractions in Riyadh that must be on your list of things to do in Riyadh are:

Skybridge in Kingdom Tower

Masmak Fort & Deera Square

National Museum of Saudi Arabia

Old Deerah (if it’s open)

Najd Village Restaurant

Edge of the World

Diplomatic Quarter

As well visiting these places to visit in Riyadh, in my opinion, in order to really enjoy your time in Riyadh, you should look to attend the many local events that are on, have a walk around a shopping mall, eat local shawarma, eat burgers at midnight (there are so many burger places in Riyadh!) and talk to people where you can.

I have a really detailed blog post on what to do in Riyadh here.

It’s better than the standard top 10 things to do in Riyadh as a tourist post and instead includes things to do in Riyadh at night, entertainment places in Riyadh, day trips from Riyadh that you can do without public transport and more, so be sure to check this out next!

I do recommend being a tourist and seeing the view from the Skybridge in the Kingdom Tower!

But also be a local and visit The 303!

Where to Eat in Riyadh

There are so many places to eat in Riyadh, however, you may guess this already but it is hard to find places because you need to drive to them all! However, there are a lot of areas that you can visit and they have lots of restaurants, cafes and shops in one area and they will give you a good insight into local Saudi life.

The most popular local dish in Saudi Arabia is Kapsa which is Rice and Meat, aside from this, you will find Restaurants selling Middle Eastern Food but aside from that Saudi’s eat a lot of Western Food. Burger restaurants are incredibly popular in Riyadh and because there are no bars in Saudi because it is a dry country, they love coffee and the cafes in Riyadh are super cool!

A few places I would say are worth the drive are:

Najd Village

This is a great place to visit for Lunch or Dinner to experience the heritage of Saudi Arabia but not leave the city! Najd Village offers traditional local food and a traditional interior and is one of the best Riyadh Restaurants for tourists to visit.

The Zone

This is an area with lots of cafes and restaurants in it so you are bound to find something you’ll like. It gets busier in the evenings and weekends especially so it’s good to visit then to see what Saudi’s do on the weekend. Greem Cafe is a Korean Cafe with a super cool 2D design.

The Boulevard Riyadh

Not to be confused with The Boulevard that is part of the Riyadh Season, this is an area with some nice restaurants and cafes. For a cool place for coffee visit Minyums!

Backyard

Another strip with lots of cool cafes, Kanakah Cafe is cool and decorated really nicely. A few years ago it was a female-only cafe but has recently changed so men can visit and it has a nice atmosphere.

Singles Section and Family Sections in Riyadh Restaurants

You may have heard that many restaurants in Saudi Arabia have a Singles section and a Families section, this is true and even as a single female you need to go in the family section, the single section is for men only.

However, this is slowly changing and a lot of the places I have recommended above do not have split sections anymore. Generally, if it’s a ‘cool and young’ place, it will not be split. But it is always worth checking to see if there is one door and two and checking if there is a sign above the door.

Najd Village Restaurant.

The Zone with lots of cafes and restaurants.

What to Wear in Riyadh

As a man, you can wear whatever you want in Riyadh and what you’d wear in other countries, although even when it’s hot Saudi men do not tend to wear shorts and show their legs so I recommend not wearing shorts.

Many Saudi men in Riyadh wear a thobe which you can purchase once you arrive and as a foreigner, I don’t think you’d look out of place wearing this, probably quite respected, but you definitely do not need to wear a thobe in Saudi Arabia and in Riyadh as a foreign male and most young Saudi guys and men don’t unless it’s a formal occasion.

As a foreign woman to Riyadh Saudi Arabia, you do need to be more aware of what you wear, but you probably know that already.

Here is my full blog post on what to wear as a woman in Saudi Arabia in 2020 and why I do wear an Abaya!

Technically, the law states that women do not need to wear an Abaya anymore in Saudi Arabia however I personally wore an Abaya all the time in Riyadh and I would have felt uncomfortable if I didn’t because all local women wear one.

You will be fine arriving in Riyadh Airport without an Abaya, no one will stay anything and you will not look out of place but I would recommend buying one as your next step when you arrive. You can google Abaya Shops in Riyadh to find one closest to you however all malls will sell Abaya’s and the cost of an Abaya is about 100 SAR / $25.00 / £20.00.

In this blog post, I give details on what type of Abaya to buy and what type not to buy!

Riyadh Travel Tips.

Here are some things that surprised me about Riyadh and to help you:

There are many migrant workers in Saudi Arabia but Riyadh especially. Most of the people that drive the Ubers, serve in cafes and shops and work in the hotels will be from countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Indonesia as well as African countries like Somalia. This isn’t a problem and I had some really nice conversations with many of the men I met working from these countries but it’s something to note so you are not surprised thinking that everyone you meet will be Saudi.

Riyadh is a very safe city. There were a few times that I felt mildly unsafe because people were staring at me. On my first day in Riyadh, I went to Masmak Fort after sunset when it was dark and had kids coming up to be begging. However, after spending more time in Riyadh and speaking to locals I realised that I was in a safe situation. Theft does not seem common in Riyadh and although as a foreign woman especially you may get the odd catcall, generally no one will say too much or approach you to be rude.

Saudi’s love to go out after sunset and stay up and out until the early hours of the morning so the best way to enjoy Riyadh is to embrace this and drink coffee at 10:00 pm or midnight to keep you awake! The North of the city at night is very safe, as are all the malls at night but if you are in the South and in an older neighbourhood like where Masmak Fort and Deera Square is, I don’t recommend you walk the streets late at night, especially as a female, you will be safe but you will be stared at.

Get a Sim Card. You will really need a sim card in Riyadh, even if you visit for a few days because you will need Google Maps and Uber without a doubt! Here’s how to get a sim card in Riyadh Airport.
