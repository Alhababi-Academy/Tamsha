The central and southern regions are warmer, averaging around 20 degrees after night fall.

Autumn

Autumn brings gentler weather and cool breezes in both Saudi Arabia’s northern region and the south western highlands. While daytime temperatures remain warm and can reach the 30’s in early fall, evenings are milder and fit for outdoor strolling, especially along cool desert springs.

Don’t forget to pack your walking shoes and sweater for air conditioned buildings and cooler evenings.

Winter

Take advantage of Saudi Arabia’s beautiful winter weather to explore the Kingdom. The balmy days and cool nights are ideal for camping, rock climbing or exploring Saudi Arabia’s verdant highlands and bustling cities, from Riyadh to Jeddah.

Essential food and drink

Mezze; Truly one of the joys of Arab world cooking and similar in conception to Spanish Tapas, with infinite possibilities.

Fuul: Mashed Fava beans served with olive oil and often eaten for breakfast.

Shawarma: Ubiquitous kebab- or souvlaki style pita sandwich stuffed with meat.

Baby Camel: Among the tenderness of Saudi meats it’s a particular speciality of Jeddah and the Hejaz.

Red Sea seafood: Fresh and varied and at its best when slow cooked over coals or baked in the oven, try samak mashwi (fish basted in a date puree and barbecued over hot coals).

Khouzi: A bedouin dish of lamb stuffed with rice, nuts, onions, sultanas, spices, eggs, and a whole chicken.

Offices working hours;

0800 to 1800 (or less commonly) 0700 -1900 with a long break. By law the working hours’ week is 48 hours’ maximum and in the month of fasting in Ramadhan 30 hours per week.

DO’S AND DON’T’S:

Taking a Siesta: If the job allows follow local practice by eating your main meal at lunch time and taking a nap in the heat of the day. Drink plenty of water so you don’t become dehydrated. Wear cotton clothing, wear a hat and sunglasses.

Breaking the law in the Arabian Peninsula can have a severe consequence for westerners. Do not take photograph without permission. This is the case when photographing people, particularly women. You should also avoid military or strategic (such as airport and bus stop).

Greetings: shake hands readily with men but wait for an Arab woman to proffer her hand first. Don’t be surprised if people touch their heart after a greeting (as in Saudi) kisses on the cheek are exchanged between men (as in the gulf states).

Don’t enter a mosque during prayer times unless you are a Muslim. Don’t extend your feet in front of you while sitting: tuck them underneath in a slouched kneeling position.

Carry cash: Whether it’s for unexpected stops in rural villages or snack stops at road side stalls, carry enough cash to see you through between ATM visits and in case of emergencies.

Credit cards are accepted everywhere and ATMS are available easily.

Eco tourism in saudi arabia on the rise

Saudi Arabia, once synonymous with oil, is now charting a new path toward a sustainable future through a series of remarkable eco-tourism efforts. At the heart of the transformation is vision 2030: an ambitious plan to decrease the country’s oil dependence in part by increasing tourism to account for 10 percent of Saudi’s gross domestic product by 2030, up from 3 percent today. The vision outlines a plan for heightened sustainability efforts nationwide, from large-scale “giga-project” developments to a massive tree-planting campaign.

The red sea project

The luxury tourism development project spans an archipelago of 90 Islands on Saudi’s coast and the shores of the Tabuk province. The giga-project, announced in 2017, is meant to attract international tourism to these unspoiled Islands, create up to 70,000 jobs, and protect the eco system on the Red Sea Coastline.

Red sea project timeline

Phase 1, which includes developing 5 Islands and two inland locations with 16 hotels offering about 3,000 rooms, is due to be completed and welcoming guests in 2024, with the entire project slated to be finished by 2030.

Dune Bashing Safari Experience in Riyadh Saudi Arabia USD 74.39 Book Now

1. Do Learn Arabic Greetings and Phrases

Learning basic Arabic greetings and phrases is not just practical; it’s a gesture of goodwill and respect in Saudi culture. Arabic is a language of hospitality, and greetings are seen as a way to connect on a personal level. Using these phrases demonstrates an appreciation of Saudi customs, opening doors to warmer interactions.

Here are a few basic phrases with their cultural context that you should get familiar with:

Marhaba (Hello) - A casual greeting that’s always welcome. Assalamualaikum (Peace be upon you) - A traditional, respectful greeting commonly used among Muslims. It conveys goodwill and peace, embodying the values of Islamic teachings. Waalaikumsalam (Peace be upon you, too) - The proper response to ""Assalamualaikum,"" shows mutual respect. Kaifa halak? (How are you? - for a man) and Kafa halik? (for a woman) - Asking about someone’s well-being is customary and displays attentiveness. Ana bekhair (I’m fine) - A polite response that shows contentment. Shukran (Thank you) and Afwan (You’re welcome) - Expressing gratitude and acknowledging others’ gestures are essential aspects of polite conversation. Fehimt (Understood) - Demonstrating that you’re engaged and comprehending what is being said can help bridge language barriers.

Making an effort to learn these phrases signals respect, often leading Saudis to engage more openly and even share aspects of their culture.

2. Do Dress Modestly

Modesty in dress is deeply rooted in Saudi Arabia’s Islamic values and cultural expectations. For women, wearing clothes that cover the body and hair reflects respect for these norms, while for men, avoiding overly casual or tight clothing shows an understanding of local customs. Traditional attire, like the “abaya” for women and “thobe” for men, are often worn as a sign of cultural pride.

This kind of dress is a sign of respect and may earn you respect in return. It's best to avoid wearing mini skirts, strapless blouses, or outfits with revealing details. Men should also avoid wearing shorts, clothing with short sleeves, or tight short pants in public.

The Saudi approach to dressing also reflects hospitality: when visitors dress modestly, they demonstrate awareness of local customs and are more likely to be met with appreciation and friendliness.

Visitors are encouraged to wear clothes that are loose and long enough to cover shoulders and knees and to avoid flashy, tight, or revealing outfits. This dress code aligns with the country’s public decorum and is a gesture of respect to Saudi society.

3. Do Not Point Fingers at Others

Pointing directly with your finger is often seen as rude or confrontational in Saudi Arabia. Instead, locals might use their chin or entire hand to gesture subtly. This tradition has its roots in Saudi society’s emphasis on humility, avoiding direct or abrupt gestures that could seem intrusive.

By avoiding pointing, visitors can show they understand the importance of humility and indirect communication in Saudi culture. Practising this simple custom can help build rapport and show attentiveness to local etiquette, making interactions more comfortable and respectful.

4. Do Remove Your Shoes When Entering a House

Saudi homes are considered private and sacred spaces, often reserved for family and close friends. Removing shoes before entering reflects an understanding of this personal boundary and is a standard custom across the Arab world. This practice is especially meaningful in Saudi Arabia, where hospitality is highly valued.

If you’re lucky enough and invited into a Saudi home, you can expect to be treated with genuine warmth, often offered traditional treats such as dates and Arabic coffee. Taking off your shoes signals respect for the cleanliness and sanctity of the host’s home. This act acknowledges the effort your hosts put into creating a welcoming environment for their guests and reflects mutual respect.

5. Do Not Use Your Left Hand Too Often

In Saudi culture, the left hand is traditionally reserved for personal hygiene tasks, and using it for public actions like eating, passing objects, or greeting others can be considered disrespectful. This norm has roots in Islamic tradition, where the right hand is favoured for clean and respectful tasks. Using the right hand in social situations, therefore, aligns with local values of cleanliness and respect.

To show cultural awareness, try using your right hand when eating, handing over money, or passing an item to someone. Even when using both hands, such as when carrying a large object, Saudis appreciate when visitors make an effort to favour their right hand. This small gesture shows attentiveness to Saudi customs, fostering positive interactions and mutual respect.

6. Do Not Show Any Public Displays of Affection (PDA)

In Saudi Arabia, maintaining a respectful distance in public interactions reflects the cultural values around modesty and propriety. Public displays of affection (PDA) are considered inappropriate and can be seen as disrespectful to local customs.

Acts such as hugging, kissing, or holding hands are typically reserved for private spaces, even among married couples. This cultural expectation upholds the values of privacy and decorum and is a part of Saudi society's adherence to Islamic principles, which encourage modest interactions.

While some leniency exists for married couples, it's still wise to refrain from PDA in public places like parks or restaurants. Visitors who respect this custom demonstrate cultural sensitivity and avoid drawing unnecessary attention, which is especially appreciated in Saudi culture.

7. Do Take Permission When Taking Photos

Photography in Saudi Arabia is approached with caution, especially when it involves people or certain places. In a culture where privacy is highly valued, asking permission before taking photos is considered a sign of respect.

Taking a photo without consent can cause discomfort, especially if it includes women or children, as many Saudis prefer not to have their images shared publicly. Some locations, such as government buildings, military sites, and areas deemed sensitive, are restricted for photography to ensure security and respect for privacy.

By asking permission first, you’re not only being courteous but also aligning with local customs, which helps you avoid misunderstandings. This respect will also allow you to capture authentic moments that locals may be more willing to share.

8. Do Pay Respect to the Elderly in Every Situation

Respect for elders is a fundamental value in Saudi Arabian culture, deeply embedded in social interactions. The elderly are seen as pillars of wisdom, their life experiences cherished by the younger generations.

Acknowledging this reverence can be shown in various ways, such as standing when they enter a room, offering them your seat in public spaces, or addressing them respectfully as “uncle” or “aunt” (even if unrelated).

In conversation, refrain from raising your voice or making abrupt gestures, as calmness and patience are valued. By showing attentiveness and listening to their stories, visitors can connect meaningfully with Saudi traditions, as these exchanges often reflect the culture’s deep-rooted respect for heritage and family bonds.

9. Do Pay Attention to Local Business Hours

Saudi business hours may differ from those in other countries, influenced by local customs and religious observances. Generally, businesses operate from 8 am to 5 pm, but with Friday as a day of worship, some establishments close, and Saturday is also typically a rest day.

During the holy month of Ramadan, business hours may shift to accommodate fasting schedules, often resulting in later openings or breaks in the afternoon.

To ensure you’re able to visit a business or attraction, check its hours in advance, either by calling or looking it up online. Respecting these local routines showcases awareness of cultural norms and helps you plan your visit more effectively.

10. Do Pay Respect During Ramadan

Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, prayer, and reflection, is a significant time in Saudi Arabia. From dawn until sunset, Muslims abstain from food and drink, and it’s customary for non-Muslims to eat or drink in private spaces out of respect for those observing the fast.

Many restaurants remain closed during the day, opening only after sunset for “Iftar,” the meal that breaks the fast. During Ramadan, the pace of life may slow, with businesses adjusting their hours to accommodate prayer and fasting.

Visitors can show respect by observing these adjustments and taking the opportunity to experience the unique cultural atmosphere of Ramadan evenings. Joining a local Iftar, if invited, is a special way to connect with Saudi customs, as it reflects the values of generosity and community that define the holy month.

11. Do Respect Prayer Times

Saudi Arabia observes five daily prayers, known as Salah, which are a fundamental part of Islamic life. During prayer times, many businesses close briefly, and activities may pause to allow people to pray. Visitors should be aware of these times, which are announced by the Adhan (call to prayer) from local mosques and vary slightly each day depending on the time of year.

When visiting during prayer times, be patient if businesses pause service, or consider planning around these times. Showing understanding and respect for these practices allows visitors to connect with a core element of Saudi culture.

12. Do Show Patience in Crowded or Busy Settings

Saudi Arabia can be bustling, especially during prayer times, at weekends, or in popular locations like souks (markets). Patience is an appreciated trait, as Saudi culture generally favours a calm, respectful demeanour over impatience or frustration in busy settings. Waiting your turn and being mindful of personal space demonstrates respect for local customs.

13. Don’t Take Food and Drink Lightly

Shutterstock.com

Sharing food is a major part of Saudi hospitality, and meals are often a communal affair where dishes are enjoyed together. Accepting invitations to share a meal is highly encouraged, as it’s a sign of Saudi generosity. When dining, try a bit of everything offered, as it shows appreciation for the host’s hospitality.

Additionally, avoid wasting food, as Saudi culture highly values the concept of “barakah” (blessing) in food. Even small gestures like showing gratitude for the meal and complimenting the dishes reflect an understanding of the culture’s respect for food and blessings.

Saudi Arabian - Etiquette,"Basic Etiquette

Saudis generally observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or passing items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.

Tipping is common in Saudi Arabia, but it is not routine. It is also not required if a service charge is already included in the bill. Saudis usually tip expatriate service people and individual services in hotels despite the overall service charge. For example, it is appropriate to leave -2USD for a porter or housekeeper.

Punctuality depends on the priority of the occasion. Saudi Arabians generally have a more relaxed approach to time-keeping in casual settings. People do not adhere to tight schedules and are quite tolerant of lateness when meeting with friends. However, punctuality is expected and adhered to in professional settings (see Business Culture ).

). It is considered rude to check the time whilst in conversation with someone or at a social gathering. Time spent with friends is considered time well spent.

Ask permission before taking anyone’s photo or posting it online, especially if they are a woman.

Avoid sitting in any position that allows one’s shoe to face another person. This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.

Try to avoid situations in which you will be left alone with a member of the opposite gender (e.g. elevators, cars). If a woman is in a car alone with a male driver, she may sit in the backseat behind the driver’s seat out of his view.

Avoid wearing tight clothes that accentuate the shape of your body or legs. Most Saudis are accustomed to seeing Western clothing. However, it is advisable to ensure your legs, arms and shoulders are covered. Women are recommended to wear a hair/head scarf covering if visiting Saudi Arabia.

Pay respect to elderly in all situations. For example, standing up when they enter a room or offering them your seat.

It is polite to avoid blowing one’s nose or spitting in public.

Casual whistling has suggestive connotations and may be seen as inappropriate depending on the context.

Loud aggression and/or drunkenness is looked upon very poorly.

Offering and Complimenting Items

There is a strong belief in the evil eye in Saudi Arabia whereby one’s misfortune is caused by another’s envy, sometimes taking the form of a curse. Complimenting or praising something too heavily can cause some Saudis to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it or curse it. People say “Mashallah” (May God bless) to ward off the evil eye after a compliment and avoid hurting people’s feelings. This phrase comforts people as it lets them know that you are giving an innocent compliment and do not wish harm. Expect to hear it highly frequently in conversation, and say it after every compliment.

In Saudi Arabia, people generally extend an offer multiple times. It is often polite to decline gestures initially and accept once the person has insisted. This exchange allows the offering person to show their sincerity in the gesture, and shows the receiver’s humbleness.

Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Saudi person may respond, “No, it’s okay”, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept on the second offer.

Be careful when you compliment an item in a Saudi person’s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Saudi person is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.

It is thought to be more sincere if compliments are given out of sight or earshot of the person who owns the possession or thing you are praising.

Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment. This is done by responding with an equally respectful compliment on the same subject. If they are Muslim, you may wish them Allah’s (God’s) blessings.

Visiting

Hospitality is highly valued in Saudi Arabian culture. One will generally find that Saudis go to great lengths to ensure their guests feel welcome. See the section on Tribal Identity in Core Concepts for an explanation of traditional Bedouin hospitality.

Saudi Arabians have a tendency to display their wealth and materialism in their personal dress, items, homes and hospitality. It is common for people to overdress for events. If a host is not overly generous, guests might be offended or think that the person is ‘cheap’.

Saudi Arabians can offer invitations to their homes multiple times and quite early on in a friendship. It is a sign of goodwill to accept.

It is inappropriate to invite someone of the opposite gender for a private visit to one’s home without an accompaniment.

Unaccompanied men should avoid visiting another Saudi man’s home without giving the family prior notice in case they accidentally intrude on the women of the house.

If a Saudi Arabian wishes for an entire family to visit their home, the male head of the family will generally extend the invitation to the other family’s eldest male.

Remove your shoes when you enter a Saudi Arabian home (especially on carpeted floors), unless instructed otherwise.

The genders are generally segregated during visits. In Saudi Arabia, many households have two different ‘majlis’ (living room/place of sitting/private place for discussion) so men and women can socialise separately.

Once segregated from the men, the women of both families can unveil in front of one another.

Men give women notice before entering an area of the house where unrelated women are socialising to give them time to cover up. For example, if a sister has her female friends visiting, her brother will announce “Ya allah!” before he walks in the room.

Male guests are usually served by the youngest son or a male domestic worker, while female guests are served by the youngest daughter or a female maid.

It is customary to be offered Arabic coffee and dates upon arrival. Coffee is often served in a ‘finjan’ (small cup).

It is good to accept any drink offered as a mark of friendship. Refusing a refreshment could create a misunderstanding around the friendship even if you are simply not thirsty.

Coffee is followed by a sweet of some kind, usually a mint and/or ginger tea.

Hosts will continue to refill guest’s cups until the guest indicates they’ve had enough by covering the mouth of the cup with their hand or gently shaking the cup from side to side and saying “Bas” (Enough).

It is improper/unclean for people to drink out of the same cup.

Hosts may light ‘Oud’ or agawood (a form of incense or oil) during a guest’s visit.

Eating

In Saudi Arabia, the consumption of alcohol (and any products containing alcohol) is prohibited for Muslims under Islamic law. It is advisable to abstain from drinking alcohol altogether if you are hosted by Saudi Arabians to avoid potential embarrassment or offence.

Pork is also prohibited in Islam. Do not serve food containing pork or pork byproducts (e.g. gelatine) to your Saudi counterpart.

It is polite to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of a Muslim during the daylight hours of the fasting month of Ramadan. In Saudi Arabia, it is considered disrespectful to engage in these activities in public.

Saudis often prepare more food than what their guests will be able to feasibly eat. Hosts often encourage guests to have second helpings and eat more even if they are full.

Try to taste all dishes on offer. Not eating very much can be perceived as rude or a sign that the food tastes bad.

It is important to wash your hands thoroughly before and after eating.

Food can either be served on a large plate set on the floor or on a table.

If the meal is on the floor, it is set on a thin plastic sheet (1m x 1m) to protect the carpet from the food. People sit cross-legged or kneel on one knee around the sheet. Keep your feet away from the cloth or plastic sheet.

When seated at a table, the most honoured seating position is in the middle of the table. Guests usually sit next to the head of the family. Do not take your seat until the eldest/most senior person has sat down.

Older restaurants may have two sections, one for men and one for families (where women and families are seated in a separate, partitioned arrangement). Newer restaurants usually have a mixed-gender open plan, that still provide the option for families to be segregated. A sign out front will indicate whether a restaurant is segregated. If there is no sign, it is usually mixed.

People only start eating once the host has said that it is time to begin. This is generally indicated when everyone says “Sahtain” (Good health) or “Bismallah” (in the name of God).

It is impolite to begin eating or drinking before the eldest/most senior person has started.

Saudi food generally does not require utensils to eat. People use their right hand, scooping with the fingers.

Use the right hand to serve and pass any food or dish, in accordance with Islamic custom. The left hand is considered unclean and shouldn’t make direct contact with food.

When eating rice, it is normal to form the rice into a small ball before placing it in the mouth. If seated on the floor, rice may drop onto the plastic sheet whilst moving it from the dish to your mouth. This is normal and socially acceptable.

Meat is stripped from the bone with the right hand. It is polite to offer other people separate bits of stripped meat.

Flat bread is a staple in almost all meals.

When the meal is finished, guests can say “Daimah”, meaning ‘may there always be plenty of food on your table’.

The main meal may be followed by more tea or coffee and some sweets.

Be aware that the time for networking and socialisation comes before the meal is eaten. Once the food has been eaten, guests generally leave very quickly after. Some Saudi men often leave very quickly after the meal is finished.

Thank the host directly before getting up from the table.

Sharing food is a major part of Saudi hospitality, and meals are often a communal affair where dishes are enjoyed together. Accepting invitations to share a meal is highly encouraged, as it’s a sign of Saudi generosity. When dining, try a bit of everything offered, as it shows appreciation for the host’s hospitality.

Additionally, avoid wasting food, as Saudi culture highly values the concept of “barakah” (blessing) in food. Even small gestures like showing gratitude for the meal and complimenting the dishes reflect an understanding of the culture’s respect for food and blessings.

Saudi Arabia Laws for Tourists

With the advent of the online Saudi Arabia visa, travel to Saudi Arabia is set to become significantly simpler.

The Saudi eVisa eliminates the requirement to apply for a visa at a Saudi embassy or consulate by allowing qualified nationals to get a tourist visa for Saudi Arabia solely online.

As part of Vision 2030, a program led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to increase tourism in the nation, a new system is being implemented to make it simpler for international visitors to come to the nation.

To modernize some of Saudi Arabia's more traditional rules, the Crown Prince's vision for the country's future also calls for significant sociological and economic changes.

Some of the long-standing harsh laws that have previously been removed include some divisive limitations on women, such as the prohibition on women being permitted to drive and attend sporting events.

Although the modernization of Saudi Arabian law is still in progress, there are a few rules and the associated penalties for breaching them that may come as a surprise to visitors from other countries.

Saudi e-Visa is a required travel authorization for travelers visiting Saudi Arabia for tourism purposes. This online process for Electronic Travel Authorisation for Saudi Arabia was implemented from 2019 by Saudi Government, with the goal of enabling any of the future eligible travelers to apply for an Electronic Visa to Saudi Arabia. Learn more at Saudi Visa Online .

What is the Saudi Arabia Law for Tourists?

As a fervently Islamic nation, Saudi Arabia is still controlled by rigorous Sharia law, which was drawn from the Quran and other Islamic books. A trial must be held if an act is performed in Saudi Arabia that is believed to be ""haram"" or capable of displacing the culprit from the Islamic religion.

As Sharia doesn't have any formal written regulations, the judge in each case must use their own judgement to interpret the law.

Saudi Arabia has a normal police force and the Muttawa, a group of volunteers and law enforcement officials that uphold Islamic morals. The answer to the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, which the Saudi Royal family runs.

They are most noticeable on Saudi streets during the 20-minute daily prayer period, five times a day, when they frequently stop people on the street, interrogate them, and direct them to the nearest mosque. Those who use prudence will have little trouble avoiding issues with the muttawa.

The government does not prohibit the private practice of other religions, and visitors are even permitted to enter the country with religious literature like the bible as long as it is for personal use.

Note: However, tourists should be aware that many other actions they would take for granted in their own country, such as openly preaching or endorsing a faith other than Islam, are illegal.

Things foreigners should not do in Saudi Arabia

Although it is generally safe to travel to Saudi Arabia, there are a few safety measures that tourists should follow to stay out of difficulty with the law there:

Avoid violating Saudi Arabia's Lese Majeste rules

It is entirely forbidden to openly criticise the Saudi Arabian government, King, royal family, or flag in any manner, even on social media. Foreign nationals are not immune from this rule, and although their sentences may not be as severe as those of locals, they might still face deportation, a public beating, or both.

Be cautious when taking pictures

Be cautious when taking pictures because it is against the law and subject to punishment in Saudi Arabia to take pictures of government or military facilities. Also, refrain from photographing locals without their consent.

Avoid wearing red on Valentine's Day

Wearing red on Valentine's Day is not recommended since it is not considered an Islamic holiday in Saudi Arabia. As a result, the government has outlawed the sale of anything red in flower and gift stores at this time.

Be discreet with your partner

It's critical to understand that LGBTQ relationships, marriage, and rights are prohibited in Saudi Arabia and are punishable by flogging, imprisonment, and even death. Nonetheless, as long as they behave discreetly and follow regional laws and customs, LGBTQ visitors are unlikely to run across any national issues. It's also crucial to remember that, regardless of whether you identify as LGBTQ or not, public shows of affection are unacceptable.

Always carry a personal ID with you

In Saudi Arabia, authorities have the right to ask for identification at any time, particularly at security checkpoints, so it's a good idea to keep your passport or a copy of it on you at all times.

Avoid eating, drinking, and smoking in public

Avoid eating, drinking, and smoking in public during the holy month of Ramadan, which is observed by Muslims worldwide as a time of fasting.

Foreign visitors should also be informed that it is strictly forbidden to bring into Saudi Arabia and/or eat the following prohibited goods:

Alcohol

Be cautious about drinking on the flight because it is illegal to carry alcohol into Saudi Arabia and to enter the country while inebriated.

Drugs

Possession, usage, and even trafficking in narcotics are prohibited and carry the death sentence.

Pornography

Saudi Arabia has severe regulations prohibiting all pornographic material, even drawings. Customs officers may check any phone, tablet, or computer you bring into Saudi Arabia for offensive photos, and any such gadgets may be seized if they are discovered.

Pork products

Bringing any type of pig product into Saudi Arabia is severely prohibited, and anybody caught trying to do so would have their goods seized.

Saudi Arabia Laws for women

There are still stringent standards of conduct and particular restrictions that women must follow when visiting the nation, notwithstanding the easing of several laws pertaining to women. Tourists should know the following Saudi Arabian laws for women to stay out of trouble:

Wear attire that respects local norms

Saudi Arabian women are still expected to wear either an abaya (a long robe, often black) or a hijab, despite certain restrictions being lifted as part of the Vision 2030 effort (headscarf). Women who are travelling should carry a headscarf if they want to enter a religious structure and are permitted to wear either an abaya or loose, modest attire. It's also important to remember that the muttawa will likely raise issues for any ladies they perceive to be overly exposed or wearing too much cosmetics.

Be wary of gender segregation

In Saudi Arabia, women are encouraged to limit their interactions with males who are not their blood relations, and they frequently receive harsher penalties for incestuous behaviour than men. Beaches, parks, and public transit will likely have segregated areas, and most public buildings will have separate entrances for each sex.

Avoid swimming in public

Saudi Arabia has several segregated gyms and pools, and women cannot use the same facilities as males. Women in Saudi Arabia are now prohibited from swimming in front of males at public beaches, despite certain resorts allowing gender-mixed bathing being expected to be implemented as part of Vision 2030.

Avoid trying on clothes when shopping

Shoppers shouldn't try on clothing since it's against the law for women to undress in public, even in a store's changing area. In Saudi Arabia, women are also prohibited from going inside graves and from reading unfiltered fashion publications.

Note: The need for a woman to be escorted by a male relative has also been greatly removed, even if many districts of Saudi Arabia are still gender segregated. Foreign women travelers are not expected to have a male chaperone during their time in Saudi Arabia, while local women frequently travel with their children without a man in attendance.

A week in Saudi : Travel guide to Riyadh and Jeddah,"When I recently got the opportunity to visit Saudi, I was super thrilled cos its a destination that has been high on my bucketlist due to its epic landscapes, rich heritage and vibrant culture. From the commercial centre of Jeddah – home to the UNESCO Old Town and one of the world’s few Formula 1 tracks – to the breathtaking Red Dunes and mesmerizing Diriyah in the capital, Riyadh, Saudi – to the magnificent desert and history in Al Ula – Saudi has so much to offer in terms of tourism.

I spent my week in Riyadh and Jeddah so I will only be covering these two destinations in my blog post. However if you are planning a trip I would highly recommend you add Al Ula, its so high on both mine and Anush’s bucketlist, we will definitely be planning a trip back to visit the Al Ula!

So without further adieu here is my quick travel guide to Riyadh and Jeddah.

Do you need a visa to go there ?

In 2019, Saudi opened its borders to tourism for the first time ever with the launch of their E-Visa program. Open to 49 countries in markets including North America, Europe and Asia, the E-Visa allows citizens of these countries to apply for a 90-day tourist visa. If you are not from any of the eligible countries you can get a visa on arrival (if you hold a multiple entry US, UK or Schengen visa in the tourist or business category) or apply at your local consulate prior to your trip.

How many days ?

1 week minimum to 10 days – you can split your time across Riyadh, Jeddah and Al Ula. All these destinations are accessible by a quick domestic flight.

How to get around ?

We got around using pre arranged taxis with drivers. Go Zahid arranges this all over Saudi.

Things to know :

Dress code for women : Saudi does not require you to wear a hijab, it is optional. It is only mandatory when you are entering mosques. Modest dress code is advisable wherein you are expected to cover your chest, shoulders, midriff. Anything below the kneees is acceptable length wise. I packed a ton of maxi dresses, abayas, loose trousers and blouses, kaftans, scarves. Its a great idea to always have a scarf on you – both for the weather as well as incase you want to visit a mosque.

Saudi Arabia’s national currency is the Saudi riyal (SAR).

Local delicacies to try – Shakshuka, Kabsa, Hummus, etc. Kabsa is considered the national dish of Saudi. The flavorful rice is topped with roast chicken, meat, or even fish, and a tomato and chili salsa is often served on the side to brighten it up.

RIYADH :

Riyadh is the birthplace of modern Saudi Arabia, where old- world charm meets 21st-century vision. Riyadh translates to “the Gardens,” a reference to the area’s past that dates to the 14th century, when the land was revered for its fertile soil, many canals and trees.

Today, Riyadh Province, also known as Al Wosta, is home to the country’s capital: a modern metropolis with a thriving financial and business center and a growing cultural scene. Riyadh’s blend of medieval and millennial makes for a beguiling cultural union — one where Arabia’s first roots can be traced, and where its bold future can be envisioned.

The city’s fascinating, centuries- old history can be found within its atmospheric souqs, compelling museums and ancient architecture, but it’s also a modern metropolis, with glittering high-rises and a burgeoning contemporary art scene.

The Convenient Travel Guide to Visiting Saudi Arabia,"Saudi Arabia used to be one of the most difficult countries to secure a tourist visa. Several years ago on a flight from Bangkok to Vietnam I remember reading an article mentioning that policies regarding travel to the country would be changing in the coming years. I made a mental note to keep an eye open for that. I was able to visit last year, spending the majority of my time in Dammam.

Traveling to Saudi Arabia can be an exhilarating adventure, with its unique blend of ancient traditions and modern innovations. The country is known for its vast deserts, vibrant cities, and rich cultural heritage; however tourism is just in its infancy. This article will provide you with essential tips and insights to make your visit to the Kingdom smooth and enjoyable.

Entry Requirements and Visa

First things first, ensure you have the appropriate visa. The introduction of the eVisa allows visitors from numerous countries to apply online. This process is straightforward and typically quick. However, always double-check the latest requirements on the official Saudi government website or consult your nearest Saudi embassy.

Best Time to Visit

Saudi Arabia’s climate is predominantly desert, with scorching summers and mild winters. And when its hot, its extremely hot; I visited in late June and the daytime temperatures in Dammam always hovered between 42 and 45 Celsius. The best time to visit is during the cooler months from October to April. During this period, temperatures are more bearable, especially for exploring outdoor attractions. Riyadh, Jeddah, and Al Ula can be particularly delightful in these months.

Respecting local customs and traditions is crucial. Public displays of affection are frowned upon, and it’s essential to be mindful of prayer times, as businesses often close briefly during these periods. My trip avoided Ramadan, the holy period that falls upon different dates each year; during this time eating and drinking in public are not allowed during daytime hours. This is something to be aware for not only travel to Saudi Arabia but also other Muslim countries.

Currency and Payments

The currency in Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Riyal (SAR). I had no problem using my U.S. issued credit cards while traveling in Dammam. However I had plenty of cash with me as well for smaller transactions like at local restaurants. ATMs are readily available; I notified my banks ahead of time of my travel plans.

Getting Around

I found transportation in Dammam challenging at times. It was hard to find public transportation and the city is so spread out. However, larger cities like Riyadh and Jeddah have well-developed public transportation systems, including buses and a metro in Riyadh. After wearing myself out by walking everywhere (especially in the heat), I discovered Uber was readily and easily available and for the rest of the trip used it to explore both Dammam and surrounding towns.

For long-distance travel, consider flying between cities. Domestic flights are frequent and relatively affordable. If you prefer a more scenic route, renting a car is a viable option. There are numerous options for this – one we absolutely do not recommend is International Drivers Association. We have talked to numerous other travelers who have had very bad experiences with this company. Saudi Arabia has an extensive road network, but remember to carry your international driving permit and familiarize yourself with local driving laws.

Dress Code and Cultural Etiquette

Saudi Arabia has a conservative dress code influenced by Islamic traditions. While the dress code has relaxed slightly for tourists, it’s important to dress modestly. Men should avoid wearing shorts in public places, and women should wear loose-fitting clothes that cover their arms and legs. An abaya (a long, black cloak) is no longer mandatory for women, but carrying one for visits to more traditional areas is advisable. I went swimming in the Persian Gulf several times and always jumped in wearing both long pants and a shirt.

Accommodation

Saudi Arabia offers a wide range of accommodation options, from luxury hotels to budget-friendly guesthouses. In major cities, you’ll find international hotel chains that provide a high standard of comfort and service. For a more authentic experience, think about staying in traditional Arabian accommodations, such as boutique hotels or desert camps.

Must-See Attractions

Saudi Arabia offers a plethora of attractions catering to diversity of interests. Here are some must-see spots:

Riyadh: The capital city is a fascinating blend of the old and new. Visit the historical Al Masmak Fortress, explore the National Museum, and marvel at the modern Kingdom Centre Tower, where you can enjoy panoramic views of the city.

Jeddah: Known as the gateway to Mecca, Jeddah is famous for its Red Sea coastline. Stroll along the Jeddah Corniche, dive into the rich marine life, and explore the historic Al-Balad district with its traditional coral houses.

Al Ula: This hidden gem is home to the UNESCO World Heritage site of Hegra (Madain Saleh). Discover ancient tombs carved into sandstone mountains, and don’t miss the breathtaking Elephant Rock.

Cuisine

Saudi Arabian cuisine is a blend of flavors and traditions. Don’t miss out on trying Kabsa, a spiced rice dish with meat, or Mandi, a fragrant rice and meat dish cooked in an underground oven. For a sweet treat, indulge in Baklava or Ma’amoul; I found plenty of bakeries in Dammam. Traditional coffee (Gahwa) and dates are a quintessential part of Saudi hospitality. I discovered only a few international restaurants during my stay in Dammam.

Safety and Health

My time in Saudi Arabia felt and was extremely safe and safety was the least of my concerns. Healthcare facilities are of high quality in major cities, but it’s always advisable to have travel insurance that covers medical expenses.

Final Tips

Language: Arabic is the official language, but English is widely understood in tourist areas and by younger generations. Most of my communication was with younger Uber drivers; for some reason they never initiated conversation but once I did so, they opened up.

Electricity: The standard voltage is 230V, and the plug type is G. Carry an adapter if your devices have a different plug type.

Water: Tap water is safe to use for washing, but it’s recommended to drink bottled water.

With its rich history, diverse landscapes, and welcoming people, Saudi Arabia is a destination that promises a memorable journey. And it is a country that is interested in building tourism. It is the only country where post trip, I received a survey directly from the government asking numerous questions about my time in the country, with requests for how to improve their tourism.

Travel Regulations

Saudi Arabia follows conservative Islamic practices. This means you need to dress modestly with clothing that covers your shoulders, arms and legs. If you’re visiting Saudi Arabia with your partner or spouse, avoid public displays of affection as it isn’t acceptable. You’ll also need to adhere to local customs and traditions, such as avoiding criticism of the royal family and respecting prayer times. We'll go into more detail on these points later on.



Another important factor to consider for your trip is travel insurance - while it’s not mandatory, having comprehensive travel insurance is highly recommended. This will cover you for medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost belongings and other unforeseen situations, giving you peace of mind for your trip to Saudi Arabia. Make sure you’re up to date with any required vaccinations and health screenings before you travel. You’ll also need to be prepared for thorough security screenings at Saudi Arabian airports and cooperate with authorities if necessary.



Currency and Travel Budget

The official currency of Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Riyal (SAR). Keep an eye on currency exchange rates before your trip to get an idea of how much your money will be worth in Saudi Riyals. It’s worth noting that most major credit and debit cards are accepted in hotels, restaurants and shops, however, it's always a good idea to carry some cash for smaller establishments or places that may not accept cards.



To help you keep an eye on your budget for your Saudi Arabia trip, research and plan your expenses in advance, factoring in accommodations, transportation, meals, sightseeing and shopping. If you’re concerned about spending too much money during your travels, you can opt for cheap activities such as eating local street food, using public transportation, purchasing souvenirs and handicrafts, visiting mosques and historical sites, and exploring local markets (souks), all of which are budget-friendly options. On the other hand, if you plan to splash out and are ready to spend a lot of money, you can choose to stay at luxury hotels, opt for fine dining restaurants, purchase luxury brands and book private tours/exclusive experiences, which won’t be hard to find in Saudi Arabia.

Travel Advice You Need To Follow

So, you made it into Saudi Arabia - what now? Keep reading to find out more travel tips that can help you safely and respectfully navigate the beautiful nation of Saudi Arabia. Once you’re in Saudi Arabia, you’ll need to consider keeping yourself safe, respecting local laws and customs and dressing modestly. If you’re visiting Saudi Arabia’s bustling cities, such as Riyadh or Jeddah, make sure you are vigilant in crowded areas, especially during events or religious gatherings.



Dressing Modestly

Get to know the Saudi Arabian laws and avoid behaviours that could be considered disrespectful or offensive to the local culture. You can be respectful by dressing modestly as Saudi Arabia has a conservative dress code, especially for women. Women are advised to wear loose-fitting, modest clothing that covers the arms and legs - this could be a long tunic or top that extends below the hips and paired with pants or a long skirt. Women can also choose to wear an abaya (a loose-fitting black cloak). It’s not mandatory for non-Muslim women to wear a headscarf (hijab) however carrying one to cover your head in certain situations can be a sign of respect.



Men also need to dress modestly and avoid clothing such as shorts and sleeveless shirts. Wearing long trousers and a shirt with sleeves is recommended to avoid being disrespectful.



But what about swimwear? It’s generally acceptable to wear swimwear at private hotel beaches or pools, however, it is very inappropriate to wear revealing swimwear in public areas in Saudi Arabia. Try to opt for more modest swimwear options wherever possible.



It’s worth noting that the degree of enforcement of dress codes may vary depending on the region you’re visiting. Riyadh and Jeddah are considered to be more cosmopolitan than other regions of Saudi Arabia, therefore there may be more flexibility with what you can wear. But to avoid any trouble, try to dress as modestly as possible.



Be Respectful

As well as dressing modestly, there are a few do’s and don’ts that you should follow when visiting Saudi Arabia.

Do not show any public displays of affection (such as holding hands or hugging). This is considered to be inappropriate and offensive. Physical contact between unrelated men and women in public is also discouraged.

Whether you’re visiting Saudi Arabia as a tourist or for business purposes, following this advice means you’ll be able to demonstrate respect for the Saudi Arabian culture and create a positive impression.





Getting Around Saudi Arabia

You’re probably thinking “Great, I now know how to respect the Saudi Arabian culture and customs, but how do I actually get around the country?”. Saudi Arabia has a continuously expanding transportation network. Depending on the city you’re visiting, different modes of transportation will be available.



Public Transport

Saudi Arabia has been investing significantly in its public transportation network in order to improve connectivity between its cities and regions. Major cities like Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam have developed modern and efficient bus networks that provide an affordable and convenient way to get around. There’s no need to worry about getting too hot in a stuffy bus - Saudi Arabia’s buses are equipped with air conditioning and are always on time, making it a popular mode of transportation for both locals and tourists.



Other than buses, Saudi Arabia has introduced a high-speed railway system called the Haramain Train. This train connects key cities such as Mecca, Medina, Jeddah and King Abdullah Economic City. It’s a comfortable and efficient way to travel between these destinations, especially for those on pilgrimage leisure trips!



Taxis and Ride Sharing

Taxis are always available in Saudi Arabia. Many taxis in Saudi Arabia don’t have meters so it’s recommended that you negotiate a fare before starting your taxi ride. Make sure to use licensed taxis from reputable companies. You can also use ride-sharing services such as Uber and Careem. With these services, you’ll get upfront pricing and you can track your ride in real-time. Payment is done safely and securely through the app.



Car Rental

If public transportation isn’t your thing, you can opt for a car rental instead. Renting a car for your trip to Saudi Arabia is a great option if you’re planning to explore multiple cities in the country. Saudi Arabia has well-maintained highways and road networks, making your road trip more enjoyable. However, if you’re considering hiring a car, you’ll need to have an International Driving Permit (IDP), as well as a valid driver’s licence from your home country. You’ll need to familiarise yourself with local traffic rules and regulations - seat belts are mandatory for all passengers and mobile phone use while driving is strictly prohibited.



Domestic Flights

What if you want to explore all corners of Saudi Arabia? The easiest way to do this is by booking multi-city Saudi Arabia flights or domestic flights within Saudi Arabia. Popular airlines that operate these types of flights include Saudia, the nation’s flag carrier airline, Flynas, a Saudi low-cost airline, and Flyadeal. With these airlines, you can visit multiple destinations within Saudi Arabia, including Riyadh, Jeddah, Medina, Dammam, Abha, Tabuk and Gassim, among others. You could even book flights to NEOM!



Whichever mode of transportation you choose, it’s crucial that you plan ahead of time the cities/towns you wish to explore in Saudi Arabia so that you can have a stress-free, enjoyable experience without getting lost!



Language and Communication

Lastly, to ensure you have a smooth and respectful travel experience in Saudi Arabia, you’ll want to think about your communication with locals and using the Arabic language.



Basic Arabic Phrases

English is widely spoken in Saudi Arabia, however, making an effort to learn and use basic Arabic phrases can go a long way in enhancing your interactions and showing respect for the local culture during your Saudi Arabia trip. Some greetings you can learn include:

“As-salamu-alaykum” (peace be upon you)

“Wa alaykum as-salam” (and unto you peace)

“Marhaba” (hello)

“Shukran” (thank you)

“Min fadlik” (please)

Learning these words can help you break the ice and create positive connections with the locals. You should also try to learn numbers as these can be used for everyday transactions, especially if you’re planning to do some shopping while in Saudi Arabia and need to negotiate prices. It’s also a good idea to learn the names of the locations you wish to visit and the landmarks you want to see!



Respectful Communication

Greeting respectfully and politely addressing people is an important cultural practice in Saudi Arabia. When meeting someone, use the appropriate greeting depending on the time of day. Address people using titles and appropriate honorifics, such as “Sheikh” for an older man or “Sheikha” for an older woman.



When communicating with Saudi Arabian locals, you should be observant of non-verbal cues. Non-verbal communication plays a significant role in Saudi Arabian culture. It’s advised to maintain eye contact when speaking as this is a sign of attentiveness and respect. But avoid prolonged eye contact between unrelated men and women as this can be considered inappropriate. In general, maintain a relaxed and friendly demeanour during conversations.



Be wary of using hand gestures when communicating, especially hand gestures that are unfamiliar or potentially offensive to the local culture. Thumbs-up and peace signs are generally understood but it's best to rely on verbal communication wherever possible.



Learning any new language that you’re not familiar with can be difficult - try to be patient and approach every conversation with a friendly attitude, especially when you are trying to convey your needs or understand others. Embracing the Arabic language will enhance your Saudi Arabia travel experience and make it more fulfilling and unforgettable!



Ready to visit Saudi Arabia?

To summarise, embarking on a journey to Saudi Arabia requires a delicate balance of preparedness and respect for its rich culture and traditions. Navigating the visa process, embracing local customs, dressing modestly and effectively communicating through language and gestures are all essential elements for a fulfilling travel experience in Saudi Arabia. By immersing yourself in the beauty of the landscape and engaging with the warmth of its people, you'll create lasting memories while contributing to a mutual exchange of understanding and appreciation.

Welcome to Saudi Arabia (and the beautiful capital city of Riyadh).

Why visit Saudi Arabia?

While the country has always received many visitors for Hajj and Umrah (pilgrimages) it has been essentially (effectively) closed off entirely for tourism until 2019.

Now it is open with a tourist visa; yet it still remains a bit of a mystery as far as mainstream tourism goes…

But for those of us (guilty) who have a particular passion for countries away from the mainstream tourist trail; Saudi Arabia fits perfectly…

Travel in Saudi Arabia with kids

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a Middle Eastern country that makes up the vast majority of the Arabian Peninsula. In other words, it’s huge!

It’s not the most common tourist destination to head for with kids but I am going to tell you about how we found it a truly great – and incredibly hospitable – travel destination that was perfect for a road trip adventure…

Joining in an auction at the bazaar in Riyadh (our first day in Riyadh; no probs!).

Visas

It’s great news regarding visas for Saudi Arabia as a traveller. International visitors from 49 countries can apply for an eVisa for Saudi Arabia. And a whole lot of those 49 can also (check pandemic changes to regulations) actually apply for a Visa on Arrival.

In order to enter Saudi Arabia (at any border entry point) visitors travelling with an eVisa also need:

An eligible passport with more than 6 months validity remaining

A valid eVisa

Evidence of onward travel to another country

Address of accommodation in Saudi Arabia

But here’s how we did it. Crossing to Saudi Arabia from Bahrain on the King Fahd Causeway we hadn’t pre-arranged eVisas for Saudi. We had done (and had fingers crossed) as much research as we could find out and understood that there was a theory we could get a Visa on Arrival at the causeway border.

And if not; we would need to hook to the wifi (literally) at the visa office right there and apply for and receive an eVisa.

This was in fact what ended up happening. And so in doing so we entered Saudi Arabia with kids and four times eVisas in our hands at the crossing.

The varied scenes of Saudi Arabia from village to city and beyond.

Getting to Saudi Arabia

There are four international airports in Saudi Arabia that travellers can enter with an eVisa:

King Khalid International Airport (RUH) – Riyadh

King Abdulaziz International Airport (JED) – Jeddah

King Fahd International (DMM) – Dammam

Prince Mohammed Bin Abdulaziz International (MED) – Madinah

And it is also possible to enter Saudi Arabia overland from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain. Which is exactly what we did.

I have written a separate guide to the overland border crossing from the Kingdom of Bahrain to Saudi Arabia. And about how to enter overland into Saudi Arabia with kids in tow. (Note: It isn’t actually that hard).

From Bahrain, entry to the country is via the King Fahd Bridge border checkpoint. This is a 25km causeway from Bahrain to the city of Khobar (less than 50km from Dammam).

Entry into Saudi Arabia by road from the UAE is via the Al Batha border crossing. This is located on the Emirates’ Western border approximately 500 km southeast of Riyadh.

Currency and cash in Saudi Arabia

The Saudi riyal is the currency of Saudi Arabia. The exchange rate in 2024 is as below:

1 SAR = 0.27 USD

= 0.27 USD 10 SAR = 2.67 USD

= 2.67 USD 100 SAR = 26.66 USD

= 26.66 USD 1000 SAR = 266.58 USD

Cash comes in notes of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 Rs.

ATM’s and money

There are many ATM’s on the roadside in Saudi Arabia (and quite seriously there are plenty of drive-through ATM’s lining the highways and huge petrol station stops!).

The first ATM we used was less than 1km after entering KSA (while we were still on the King Fahd Causeway middle island). The most common banks we found and used with our international bank cards while in Saudi Arabia were:

NCB

Al Rajhi Bank

Riyad Bank

Each of these ATM’s worked for us each time and had the menu option in English on the first page of display.

Al Rajhi Bank (somewhere on the way to Yanbu) showing the male and female entrances at this branch.

Language

Going in to shops and restaurants in the big cities you will find people that speak some English. However out in rural Saudi Arabia an English translation is much more limited.

It is hugely appreciated if you can greet and thank people you meet in Arabic. And even if you can’t speak much more than that; do not worry! The people of Saudi Arabia are extremely hospitable and welcoming and will make sure you are comfortable even without a common language to do so.

Places to visit in Saudi Arabia

Alright. The country is HUGE. It is in fact the 13th largest country in the world by land size area so there is much to see. And each of the different regions of the country is very different from the last.

Here are the highlights from our time in Saudi Arabia with what we would recommend you prioritise in each place…

Dammam

The northern coastal city of Dammam is somewhere that has boomed since the discovery of oil and thus petrol in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. From the history we observed on display at the incredible Heritage Village in Dammam (see below) it was a fairly average-sized city before the boom of industry and the rush of people moving to the area.

Things to do in Dammam

Heritage Village: A must see in Dammam! This was a highlight for us and a great way to learn about the different regions of Saudi Arabia.

Al Hofuf

Known also as Al Hufuf, this city of Saudi Arabia in the Eastern Province not only has one of the largest oil fields in the world but is also one of the largest date producers in the world. Al Hofuf is situated in the largest oasis in the world with huge groves of palm trees; counted at over two million.

Things to do in Al Hofuf

Qaisariah Souq: Traditional market place selling gold jewellery, gifts and textiles.

Riyadh

This is the capital city of Saudi Arabia and there are endless options of sights to see and activities to do in Riyadh; literally from luxury tours and restaurants to hiking on the outskirts at the famous ‘Edge of the World’.

Things to do in Riyadh

Kingdom Tower: Riyadh’s iconic and ultra-modern skyscraper. You can walk along the skybridge for an epic view of the city.

AlUla

The very famous Madain Saleh is located near the city of AlUla and is the iconic image you will have seen of Hegra; the beautiful rock city in the desert that looks a lot like neighbouring Petra in Jordan.

The official AlUla website has all the information for visiting Hegra and buying tickets online.

Things to do in AlUla

Madain Saleh/Hegra: The southernmost settlement of the Nabatean Kingdom (the kingdoms second largest settlement after Petra) consisting of over 131 tock-cut monumental tombs and caves.

Hotel Pakistan: We have added this in as a must-try attraction (ok; restaurant) in AlUla. This has to be some of the best food we came across in Saudi Arabia!

Incredible Hegra in AlUla.

Yanbu

A port city of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia (and for us a halfway(ish) point between AlUla and Jeddah in the south). Yanbu is actually the second largest port city on the south of the country (after Jeddah) and one of the oldest seaports on the Red Sea with history dating back approximately 2500 years.

Things to do in Yanbu

Yanbu Historical Area: An interesting area on the waterfront (currently under construction) to get a sense of architecture and housing style in this area of KSA.

Jeddah

The port city of Jeddah has long been regarded as Saudi Arabia’s cultural capital; the perfect blend of old and new. Jeddah has always served as the gateway to Mecca, Islam’s holiest city. And as a result has been heavily influenced by the influx of pilgrims it has received over the centuries.

Things to do in Jeddah

Jeddah Corniche: A great picnic spot and (obviously) beautiful place for a walk along the Red Sea and waterfront.

Check out our video of trying Saudi’s famous restaurant and I reckon you will be convinced too…

It’s all happening in the old city of Al Balad in downtown Jeddah.

Transportation from Jeddah

Drive to Al Bahah: 5 hours

Drive to Yanbu: 3.5 hours

Drive to Al Qunfudhah: 4 hours

Drive to Riyadh: 9.5 hours

Flight to Riaydh: 1.5 hours

Al Bahah

Al Bahah is one of Saudi Arabia’s prized destinations; not only for international visitors but for domestic tourism as well. It enjoys a pleasant climate and is surrounded by natural sights and beauty with more than 40 forests and waterfalls.

Things to do in Al Bahah

King Fahd Mountain Pass: A drive along King Fahd’s Mountain Pass serves up some of the best views in Al Baha with scenic villages and deep valleys.

Dhe Ayan: Often called the Marble Village this is another historic village of the past where the cuboid buildings are made of stone and slate and tucked right up into the hillside.

Travel tip: I’m adding this as an official travel tip in our Saudi Arabia travel guide because the beautiful King Fahd Mountain Pass is worth a drive just for the views of epic valleys and villages. Even if you aren’t stopping and staying in Al Bahah I would recommend coming this way around towards Abha.

Hilltop village sand stone buildings (hidden) en route to Abha.

Abha

The hilltop city of Abha is the capital city of the Aseer Province in the southwest of the country. It’s known as a summer playground or resort town for Saudi nationals (to escape the heat of the desert cities during the peak of summer holidays) as well as hosting tourists from all over the GCC that flock here to escape the sweltering summer heat.

(So do note; it can get particularly busy during those summer months and accommodation prices not only skyrocket but make it hard to find somewhere to stay. Plan ahead with that one…

Things to do in Abha

Rijal Almaa: This beautiful village is on UNESCO’s tentative heritage list as a colourful stone village that’s original homes have stood the test of time now for centuries. Now a restored touristic site and museum the village is worth the drive from Abha to visit.

Food in Saudi Arabia (you need to try)

Food plays a very important role in traditional Saudi Arabian culture and is seen as a symbol of hospitality.

The most common food items you will come across on your travels in Saudi Arabia include rice, chicken, lamb, spices, yoghurt, potatoes, bread and dates. LOTS of dates.

Kabsa: Rice and roast chicken with fried onions, raisins, pine nuts (the most famous dish in Saudi Arabia!)

And there was that time our host family cooked us an entire FEAST in Saudi!

What kind of food will the kids eat while we’re in Saudi Arabia?

It’s definitely a fair call to be contemplating travel in Saudi Arabia with kids and wondering what on earth they are likely to eat while you’re there…

Here are some firm favourites we found during our month of travels (that was not including the supermarket packaged treats that I do admit were also handy when in transit on a road trip between cities!).

Arayes: Crispy pita bread sandwiches

Crispy pita bread sandwiches Shakshouka: Poached eggs in cooked tomato sauce – this one we had at breakfast time in a couple of places.

Poached eggs in cooked tomato sauce – this one we had at breakfast time in a couple of places. Jallab: Basically a fruit syrup!

Basically a fruit syrup! Basbousa: Semolina cake

Semolina cake Muhallebi: Milk pudding made with rice flour

Travelling with kids in Saudi Arabia is an amazing experience!

Also note that most markets don’t open until late afternoon (around 4pm). AND I have to say that only a couple of hotels out of alllll the different ones we stayed at actually included breakfast in the room charge. (I mean seriously they barely even offered utensils or crockery).

So don’t get the idea of filling up on breakfasts for the days adventures. Best to head to the markets or find a roadside restaurant (we can recommend a few of those we enjoyed!).

Transportation in Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia is a huge country to travel around. (Remember; it’s the 13th biggest country in the world by land-size!). But the good news is that it is also a country with multiple options for travel – overland, by public transport (train) or by flight.

Here is what we found about transportation in Saudi Arabia condensed into the following Saudi Arabia travel guide!

Getting around Saudi Arabia by train

The Dammam-Riyadh train line offers a (relatively) budget-friendly way to travel between the largest Saudi cities (with a view).

There are six daily departures on two trains (one operating Sunday through Thursday and the other on Thursdays and Saturdays).

The trains we went on between Dammam and Riyadh have Premium (1st) class and Standard (2nd) class, a café on board and even a prayer area.

Tickets between Dammam and Riyadh cost:

1 st class: 136.50 SAR (USD $37)

136.50 SAR (USD $37) 2nd class: 78.75 SAR (USD $21)

There is also a North Train that connects Riyadh to the north of Saudi Arabia and serves the following stations:

Riyadh

Al Majmaah

Qassim

Hai; and

Al Jouf.

And the Haramain High-Speed Railway popular with pilgrims is the latest and fastest train in the Middle East, operating between the holy cities of Makkah and Medina in western Saudi Arabia. It serves the following stations: Makkah, Jeddah, King Abdullah Economic City and Medina. (Note you cannot visit Makkah as a non-Muslim tourist).

Travelling by train in Saudi Arabia = NO WORRIES!

Getting around Saudi Arabia by rental car

Although you might have heard tales fast and erratic driving in Saudi Arabia (sorry; they’re mostly true) and be put off the consideration of hiring a car in Saudi; it is actually a great way to get around the country. (As long as you’re a confident driver). Because the country is geographically HUGE!

There are maddening crowds and traffic in the big cities, mountain switchbacks (looking at you, Abha) and dark desert highways that stretch for literally miles on end.

But in actual fact road conditions are fairly good and when we rented a car and drove in Saudi Arabia (ok, Gavin drove) this year we had a great experience and found it an economical way to get from one side of the country to (almost literally) the other.

Cars in Saudi Arabia are left-hand drive and automatic transmission is standard.

And luckily, petrol in Saudi Arabia is cheap (no surprises there). Petrol costs about 1.5 riyal/L ($0.40 USD) for 91 and 2 riyal/L ($0.50 USD) for 95.

Note: As a non-resident (tourist) you do need to have an International Driving Permit (IDP) to rent a car and drive in Saudi Arabia.

We hired a car through Avis rentals and found their service particularly good. We picked up the car in Tabuk and returned it to Jeddah three weeks later. A great experience.

Signs for the roads TO Meccah and the ring road AROUND.

Getting around Saudi Arabia by plane

Getting to Saudi Arabia is easy these days with four international airports served by a wealth of different international carriers.

Saudi Arabia also operates 15 domestic airports around the country with three carriers that make short hops between regions fairly cost effective too.

flyadeal

FlyNas

Saudia

Saudi Gulf

Nesma Airlines

It’s easy to book flights online through each carriers website (or using a larger flight scanning app or site).

Travelling by plane in Saudi is easy.

Getting around Saudi Arabia by taxi

It’s fairly easy to get a taxi in the major cities of Saudi Arabia. (In Dammam we were picked up by a taxi driver who said he couldn’t bear to see us outside in the heat and insisted on dropping us off for free!).

The cheapest option is definitely Uber although sometimes we found with the long wait time it wasn’t the most sensible choice (especially waiting in the heat with kids).

In Dammam an Uber for 3km cost us around 15SAR. And in Riyadh during the peak evening time we got an Uber for 10km for 45SAR.

Sometimes it’s worth a taxi or Uber into town to be dropped off.

Budgeting for Saudi Arabia

There’s no need to beat around the bush with this part of the travel guide for Saudi. Whether you are in Saudi Arabia with kids or not; it is an expensive country to travel in.

Not only is it above average costs for the daily budget as a traveller; it is expensive to enter the country (see above section about visas) unless you are a Gulf country citizen or resident worker. But there are different options for food and drinks (like a supermarket or finding a smaller non-chain restaurant) that can help to budget for your trip…

Water (1L): 2 SAR

(1L): 2 SAR Soft drink (can): 4 SAR

(can): 4 SAR Coffee (Starbucks): 18 SAR

(Starbucks): 18 SAR Ice cream (packaged): 3 SAR

(packaged): 3 SAR Meal at McDonalds:

at McDonalds: Sharwarma: 15 SAR

15 SAR Hummus: 8 SAR

8 SAR Chicken kabab: 24 SAR

24 SAR Mixed grill meat platter: 35 SAR

meat platter: 35 SAR Pizza (restaurant): 35 SAR

(restaurant): 35 SAR Uber (3km): 15 SAR

(3km): 15 SAR Uber (peak time; 10km): 45 SAR

(peak time; 10km): 45 SAR SIM card (STC with 20GB): 95 SAR

This green and yellow logo for mini/supermarkets are everywhere throughout the country.

Connectivity and WIFI

WIFI is a bit hit and miss across accommodation in Saudi Arabia. (That’s putting it politely. Don’t get your hopes up; sorry). We’ve have some hotels that were great and WIFI

was fast and included in the price. And then others where the signal is so weak it can’t even pick up the supposed ‘free WIFI’…

The major cities have 5G mobile reception which with a local SIM and data makes it the most efficient way to navigate the country (especially if driving by car as the distances between cities – or even shops or villages where people might help – are huge).

SIM cards and data

There are 3 main operators in Saudi Arabia: STC, Mobily and Zain.

They have similar packages and prices and coverage is great in the cities. All the SIM cards are valid for 7 or 30 days in Saudi Arabia.

STC KSA : SAR 30 and comes with SAR 25 with of credit

: SAR 30 and comes with SAR 25 with of credit Mobily : prepaid plans for SAR 25, 30, 75, and 150

: prepaid plans for SAR 25, 30, 75, and 150 Zain KSA: 55 SAR for 2GB data

From what information I could find before we arrived (we needed a Saudi Arabia travel guide and hence creating this one!) it sounded like STC is the best option (it’s the largest phone operator in the country).

Prices for a prepaid STC sim card in Saudi Arabia:

65 SAR ($17 USD): 2GB data, 5GB social media, 500 minutes

90 SAR ($24 USD): 8GB data, 200 minutes

160 SAR ($42 USD): 10GB data, unlimited social media and calls

SIM card registration is mandatory in Saudi Arabia and will be done at the point of sale (using your passport information). And you also have to provide your fingerprint for additional security (true).

Buying an STC SIM in Dammam after we arrived.

Accommodation options in Saudi Arabia

Alright this area of our Saudi Arabia travel guide is going to just be honest and let you know what accommodation in Saudi Arabia is like.

I wouldn’t rate it. I assume if you have lots of money and are traveling in luxury through the Kingdom (as many domestic and international travellers are) as it is renowned for; then truly your options are limited. There are not backpacker hostels or even backpacker-type places to stay yet. It’s only early days.

So there is a weird combination of budget chain hotels (OYO) that aren’t in fact actually budget prices. And smaller hotels trying to offer what might have once looked like luxury accommodation (headboards so big the bed hardly fits in the room and lace and overexaggerated furniture).

But the most odd thing about the accommodation has to be in the kitchens. Seriously, some of the kitchens are ridiculously enormous. Huge cook-tops, full-size catering ovens, fridges and a huge dining. But no cutlery and no crockery and no pots and pans. Like; none at all.

And if you go to the reception to ask if you might have a cup to use with the provided electric kettle they look at you very strangely. They might if you’re lucky call housekeeping who will need the security guard to translate your very unusual request and might provide you with a paper cup (even two) for a hot drink. Nice.

But overall we did manage to make our way around the country trialling a range of accommodation options. Some we would recommend and stay in again and some maybe not.

Against the Compass,"Saudi Arabia, one of the most hermetic countries in the world for non-Muslims, seems to be finally changing and opening its borders to international tourists.

Let me tell you something:

Saudi is a great country, composed of lovely people, extremely hospitable, and home to some stunning natural sites, as well as jaw-dropping archaeological sites that you would never imagine.

It is really one of those countries which requires a couple of months to discover because, given its dimensions, there are loads, loads of things to see.

Seriously, I can’t recommend Saudi enough.

For all the practical information, including visas, don’t forget to read how to travel to Saudi Arabia."
Ultimate Travel Guide to Saudi Arabia: Everything You Need to Know,"Saudi Arabia is a land of contrasts—modern skyscrapers and ancient traditions, vast deserts and bustling cities. Whether you’re traveling for business, leisure, or cultural exploration, this guide will help you navigate your trip effortlessly. One of the most important aspects of any international journey is staying connected, and in this guide, we’ll also introduce you to the easiest way to stay online during your trip: the Pocket eSIM Saudi Arabia Plans.

Preparing for Your Trip to Saudi Arabia

Traveling to Saudi Arabia is an exciting adventure, but there are a few things you should prepare in advance to ensure a smooth experience:

1. Visa Requirements

Saudi Arabia now offers e-visas for travelers from many countries, making the process much simpler. Whether you’re visiting for business, tourism, or attending one of the many cultural events, check the official visa guidelines for eligibility and requirements.

2. Internet and Communication

In today’s digital age, reliable internet access is a must. Instead of relying on local SIM cards that require time-consuming registration, consider using a Pocket eSIM. It’s a hassle-free, digital alternative that allows you to connect instantly upon arrival.

3. Dress Code and Cultural Awareness

Saudi Arabia has a more conservative dress code than many other countries. While traditional clothing isn’t mandatory for foreign visitors, it’s important to dress modestly out of respect for local customs. Women should avoid revealing clothing, and men should opt for long trousers instead of shorts in public places.

4. Currency and Payments

The official currency in Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Riyal (SAR). Credit cards are widely accepted in urban areas, but carrying some cash for smaller transactions or rural locations is always a good idea.

Why Use an eSIM in Saudi Arabia?

Traveling without reliable internet can be inconvenient, especially in a country as large as Saudi Arabia. From navigating cities like Riyadh or Jeddah to using essential apps like Google Maps, staying connected is a must. Here’s why you should consider an eSIM:

Instant Activation

With Pocket eSIM Saudi Arabia Plans, you can skip the long lines and paperwork required for traditional SIM cards. Simply download the eSIM to your phone, scan the QR code, and you’re ready to go.

Affordable Data Packages

Avoid expensive international roaming fees with Pocket eSIM’s affordable data plans tailored specifically for Saudi Arabia. Choose the plan that suits your needs and only pay for what you use.

Seamless Connectivity

Unlike relying on public Wi-Fi, which can be spotty or insecure, Pocket eSIM ensures you have fast, reliable internet wherever you go in Saudi Arabia.

Top Places to Visit in Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia offers a mix of modern attractions and historical wonders. Here are some must-visit destinations:

1. Riyadh

The capital city of Saudi Arabia is a blend of old and new. Visit the Kingdom Centre Tower for stunning views of the city, or explore Diriyah, the historic birthplace of Saudi Arabia. Riyadh is also a hub for fine dining and luxury shopping.

2. Al Ula

A gem in Saudi Arabia’s northwest, Al Ula is home to breathtaking natural landscapes and the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Hegra (Madain Salih). This ancient archaeological wonder is a must-see for history enthusiasts.

3. Jeddah

Located on the Red Sea, Jeddah is famous for its vibrant coastal atmosphere. Walk along the Jeddah Corniche, admire the historic Al-Balad district, or dive into the Red Sea to experience its stunning underwater world.

4. Edge of the World

This iconic natural landmark, located near Riyadh, offers dramatic cliffs and breathtaking desert views. It’s perfect for those who love outdoor adventures and stunning landscapes.

How to Get Around in Saudi Arabia,"Buses, trains, cheap flights, and taxis – getting around Saudi Arabia is much easier than you might think.

Just a few years ago, Saudi Arabia was one of the most secluded countries in the world, and tourism was not even permitted. Well, the situation has drastically changed. Saudi Arabia now welcomes tourists and is building a tourism infrastructure larger than that of the UAE and Qatar.

I visited Saudi Arabia during its initial opening phase and now I’m planning a second trip in the coming days. I loved traveling overland in Saudi Arabia and this time, I have plans of taking buses to remote areas, a train to the holy city of Madina and even hitchhike. With everything set to go, I want to show you what I learnt and tell you how you can get around Saudi Arabia using buses, the new train system, taxis, ride-hailing apps, and car rentals.

Find what you need in one click

I visited Saudi Arabia right after the country opened for tourism. First thing I did: Get a traditional outfit.

Entering Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia is investing large resources to become a main stopover destination for travelers moving between Asia and Europe. With Saudia, the largest carrier in Saudi Arabia, becoming a large competitor against Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad, the aviation landscape is evolving rapidly.

Budget airlines such as Fly Dubai and even WizzAir have also entered the market, and it’s only a matter of time before we see flights from Europe with Ryanair or EasyJet.

Riyadh, Jeddah, or Dammam are the three largest airports in the country and are likely to be your initial points of entry into Saudi Arabia. Moreover, with a straightforward e-visa process for most nationalities, Saudi Arabia is poised to attract a growing number of tourists in the coming years.

I hold a Colombian passport and usually have to apply for a visa at the embassy if I want to visit Saudi Arabia. However, some exceptions might apply to you too.

For travelers requiring an e-visa or opting for visa on arrival, here is the link to apply for an e-visa.

For visa-required visitors holding US, UK, or EU visas, here is the link to obtain an e-visa.

Tip: Book your accommodation with Agoda

Be connected at all times in Saudi Arabia.

I got a e-SIM with SIM Local and got packages depending on my internet consumption.

They offer packages from 1, 3, 5, 10 and even 20 GB.

They also have a current discount of 10% at the link here.

Riyadh became a very popular starting point for a trip in Saudi Arabia

Traveling Between Cities with National Flights

Saudi Arabia is big! Very big, and traveling long distances within the country can be time-consuming. Domestic flights offer a convenient and efficient means of transportation for intercity travel.

Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam serve as major transportation hubs, with the two local airlines, Saudia and Flynas, operating regular flights between major domestic destinations. This makes it easy to explore different regions of the country without taking lengthy road journeys.

Additionally, the strategic locations of these airports, Damman very east, Riyadh in the center of Saudi Arabia and Jeddah in the west coast, enable travelers to access a significant portion of the country by visiting these three key hubs.

Other popular destinations in Saudi Arabia, such as Madina (recently opened for tourism) and Al Ula, have also several daily flights departing from these hubs, with fares starting at 50 EUR in low season.

During my first trip to Saudi Arabia, I traveled by train from Dammam to Riyadh, flew from Riyadh to AlUla and then flew again from AlUla to Jeddah.

Witnessing Eerie Landscapes with the Saudi Arabian Train System

Traveling by train is among the most enjoyable and convenient ways to get around Saudi Arabia. The country boasts the best train infrastructure in the entire Arabian Peninsula, and with ongoing expansions, it’s only a matter of time before the entire country and neighboring nations are interconnected.

Currently, there are two operational sections of the train system, each operated by different companies.

Saudi Arabia Railways connecting the east of the country

The Haramain High-Speed Railway connecting the west of the country

Thankfully, there are numerous trains operating throughout the day, making last-minute ticket purchases hassle-free.

Trains Connecting Eastern Saudi Arabia

Saudia Arabia Railways operates two passenger train lines. One connects the capital, Riyadh, to the coastal city of Dammam (4 hours), while the other links Riyadh to Al Quorayyat near the Jordanian border (11 hours).

The Al Quorayyat – Riyadh line will take you to the closest town to the Jordan border.

For travelers on the Dammam-Riyadh line, I highly recommend a stopover in the city of Al Hofuf. Located right in the middle of the desert, Al Hofuf is a charming town that I had the pleasure of visiting during my first trip to Saudi Arabia. It’s an ideal location for an overnight stay, or if your time is limited, a short, but rewarding day trip.

A train between Dammam and Riyadh will take 4 hours

Trains Connecting Western Saudi Arabia

The Haramain High-Speed Railway connects Jeddah with the holy cities of Mecca and Madina. Bookings for this service are made through a separate website. Link Here. With one of the fastest trains globally serving these destinations, this is the optimal choice for travel within this region of Saudi Arabia.

Moreover, this train route passes through Jeddah’s International Airport, making it a convenient starting point for your Saudi Arabian journey. During my upcoming trip, I plan to take this train to visit the city of Madina, which recently opened for tourism. It’s an incredible opportunity to explore one of the holiest cities globally.

The Mecca – Jeddah – Madina train line in Saudi Arabia connects millions of pilgrims every day.

Unlike Madina, Mecca is still limited to Muslim pilgrims and even though there is not any control to “verify your religion at the entrance”, it would be a lack of respect to visit this city just for the sake of visiting Mecca. I have read in forums about travelers bragging their visits to Mecca, and I find it very disrespectful to visit a forbidden city just for saying you have been there.

Upcoming train lines in Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia is also planning to open a few more important lines in the next years. The GCC line should connect the countries of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE by train, and there is a connecting line between Jeddah and Riyadh under construction.

Keep in mind, railway tickets with Saudi Arabian Railways and with the Haramain High-Speed Railway are only a fraction of the price compared to flights (even with the budget airlines), and the trains in Saudi Arabia are brand new – making the experience of taking a train in Saudi Arabia a total treat. This is my favorite way to travel in Saudi Arabia, and I can’t wait for the upcoming lines (especially the GCC line) to open.

The GCC line will become one of the most important transport train connections in Asia

International and national buses

Even though Saudi Arabia’s neighboring countries are not yet connected with high-speed trains or budget flights, buses are quite reliable for those who want to combine Saudi Arabia with Bahrain or the UAE.

International buses in Saudi Arabia

For international travel, SAPTCO is the only company that offers bus connections between Saudi Arabia and these countries. Tickets are quite affordable, and all departures start from the city of Dammam.

A trip from Dammam to Dubai takes around 13 hours, or a trip from Dammam to Bahrain takes only 2.5 hours. Unfortunately, there are only one or two connections every day, and booking a ticket at least a few days in advance is recommended.

I visited Bahrain using the SAPTCO bus connecting Dammam and Bahrain. I booked everything online

What about buses between Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar?

Unfortunately, there are no buses connecting these destinations. Travelers wanting to visit Qatar from Saudi Arabia have to travel with a private transfer or take a flight. In Qatar, non-GCC travelers also have issues entering the country with their own cars, so don’t try it.

For Kuwait is exactly the same. The easiest option is to get to the border town and from there arrange a private vehicle to cross you. I did this to get from Dammam to Bahrain and it worked very well. It was very expensive though.

And yes, you can get VOA (visa on arrival) at any of the land borders in Saudi Arabia (if your nationality applies for it).

NOTE: SAPTCO also manages most municipal buses in Saudi Arabia, but for the intermunicipal buses, SAPTCO is rebranded as Satrans for national intercity buses.

Getting a Saudi visa is everyday easier. It’s just a matter of time until the country becomes visa free for everyone.

National buses in Saudi Arabia

For those wanting to travel between Saudi Arabia by bus, there are two companies available on the market:

This is the most affordable way of traveling around Saudi Arabia, but also the least efficient and slowest. Buses from Riyadh to Jeddah with Satrans take around 12 hours and cost around 50 EUR one way. This is not worth the price, taking into consideration that a flight might cost only 20 EUR more and take only 1 hour.

While Satrans also connects Jeddah with Riyadh, most bus stations from Satrans are located in the south of the country.

Here is a map of all Satrans stations located in Saudi Arabia.

For travelers going north, Northwest Bus is their best option. Here, you can find bus connections to Madina and even to AlUla.

With local buses you can easily get to AlUla. Saudi Arabia’s big highlight.

Car rentals for total freedom

Car rentals in Saudi Arabia are also quite popular. This is the most convenient option for planning day trips around key cities and moving short and remote distances. Major cities like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam have standard car rental companies offering a wide range of vehicles to suit every budget. Additionally, Saudi Arabia’s well-maintained highways and roads are relatively straightforward, making self-driving a popular choice.

Most (if not all) travelers in AlUla rent a car to move around more freely, and more experienced travelers can get a vehicle in Madina and travel from this holy city to AlUla on a road trip.

Unlike Oman, where a 4WD vehicle improves the travel experience a lot, you can get in Saudi Arabia a small car for 40-50 EUR per day and make the most of the country.

Read more: What are the best things to do in AlUla

The only way to visit this place in AlUla is by renting a car and traveling there.

Taxis and Ride-Hailing Services (Uber, Careem, and Co.)

Yes, Uber works in Saudi Arabia. This is one of the most convenient apps to move around large cities. Rides may be a bit more expensive than conventional taxis with a taximeter, but the convenience of Uber is simply flawless. Careem is another company that works very well in the Middle East. A ride with Careem may be a bit cheaper than Uber, but this is not always the case – there is for sure more availability.

Taxis in Saudi Arabia also work very well. Unlike countries like Egypt and Jordan, in which you have to negotiate with the driver, in Jeddah or Riyadh, you can simply hail a cab, and the driver will automatically use the taximeter. This is one of the most convenient ways to travel around Saudi Arabia’s cities.

Read more: Why should you visit Sharjah in the UAE

Due to the long distances and non-optimal public transport in Riyadh, Uber was my app to go.

What about hitchhiking in Saudi Arabia?

I have met several travelers who hitchhiked in Saudi Arabia and found it a great adventurous option. Based on my research on travel forums, this was an option for travelers trying to get to Qatar from Saudi Arabia for the World Cup. Other travelers have covered remote parts of Saudi Arabia hitchhiking and have not found any trouble. Saudi Arabia is probably one of the safest countries in the world (for men and women), and you will only encounter friendly people trying their best to help. The only risk is that you gain weight from all the invitations to have dinner with a random family.

NOTE: Crossing borders on foot in Saudi Arabia is forbidden. If you try this, you will be sent back at the first checkpoint.

Read more: Which are the top adventure activities in AlUla

Despite the description of the country in some news media, I felt in Saudi Arabia extremely welcomed. Everyone spoke very good english and I was able to talk to everyone about everything.

Communication in Saudi Arabia

When it comes to direct communication with locals, Saudi Arabia has a very high index of education. Most people I encountered on my trip spoke perfect English, and those who didn’t were extremely friendly and helpful in whatever I needed.

Additionally, having a connection to the internet at all times was super practical for translating or asking where to go.

For those concern about paper tickets and communication at bus and metro stations, all bookings for busses and trains are possible to do online, and online tickets are the standard in the country.

Read more: How to plan a road trip in Oman

Madina opened for tourism and maybe Mecca might open too in the upcoming years.

When it comes to internet connection on the road, during my first visit in Saudi Arabia, I got a SIM card from Virgin with 20GB for 20 EUR (more or less). This is still the cheapest option for travelers needing high data.

For my second trip, I will use my global plan of Flexiroam and maybe get a local SIM card with Virgin once I settle down in Jeddah.

The most convenient option is to get a country plan with Airalo a few days before traveling. A 10 GB plan costs 25 EUR, but you will get internet right after you land in Saudi Arabia."

Once one of the most difficult countries to visit, Saudi Arabia is finally issuing visas for tourism purposes and independent travel.

Before, the only way to travel to Saudi was on a business visa, via a strong local connection who could sponsor your visit, or by getting a pilgrimage visa to visit Mecca and Medina (only for Muslims).

Therefore, the fact that all of a sudden, Western tourists can visit Saudi Arabia on their own, with a backpack, both men and women, is a very radical change.

This incredibly big change, however, didn’t come alone.

During the last couple of years, a lot of their super strict Islamic laws have been softened or, at least, they have become more flexible. For example, allowing women and men to hang out together in public spaces was one of the most significant changes.

All these small changes will make things easier for future international visitors.

Despite everything that you may have read in the media, Saudi Arabia is an incredible country. There is just so much to do and see, a country filled with loads of stunning sites, both natural and archaeological, hugely contrasting landscapes and some extremely hospitable people that could easily rival my beloved friends from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran.

I strongly believe that this is the most underrated country on this planet, and here I have compiled a comprehensive travel guide to Saudi Arabia packed with tips and everything you need to know to travel to the Kingdom.

🪪 How to get a visa for traveling to Saudi Arabia

For visiting Saudi, you can either apply for an e-visa or get a visa on arrival.

Which countries are eligible to visit Saudi with tourist e-visa?

All EU countries + Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Montenegro, Norway, San Marino, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Ukraine and the United States,

How to apply for Saudi tourist e-visa

You can easily apply for it through visitsaudi.com

This is what the tourist visa for Saudi looks like.

Just follow the steps, and you will be on the way.

How much does the Saudi e-visa cost?

The total visa price is 535 Saudi Rials, which is around 142 US Dollars.

From that amount, 180 Saudi Rials refer to the Saudi travel insurance, a COVID-related requirement.

How long is it valid for?

The visa allows you to stay in Saudi for 90 days, and it has a 1-year validity from the issuance date.

It’s also valid for multiple entries.

This means that, within a year, you travel to Saudi as many times as you want with the same visa, as long as your stay doesn’t exceed more than 90 days.

My visa for Saudi Arabia

How to get a visa on arrival (VOA) for Saudi Arabia

In 2023, they also introduced a VOA regime, valid for any entry port into Saudi Arabia.

The VOA on arrival costs 300 Saudi Rials, but they also make you buy travel insurance, which costs an additional 180 Saudi Rials.

The total cost is 480 SR, cheaper than the e-visa.

As of today, nobody understands why should someone go through the hassle of applying for an e-visa, when the VOA costs 55 SR less.

Can single women apply for a Saudi visa?

Yes, they certainly can, no restrictions for being a female.

What about the rest of the nationalities, can they travel to Saudi?

Actually, yes, they can.

A fellow traveler with an Argentinian passport told me that she applied at the embassy in Buenos Aires and managed to get her visa in only 1 week.

She had to present things like a payslip, vaccines, return flight ticket, and things like that.

Also, travelers with valid US and Schengen visas – and that includes Indian and Pakistani citizens – can also get a visa for Saudi on arrival.

⛅ Best time to visit Saudi Arabia

The best time to visit Saudi Arabia is during the cooler months, from November to February.

March, April and October could be bearable but outside this ”winter season”, the country could be too hot to enjoy.

By the way, note that the north of Saudi Arabia can be extremely cold in winter, with temperatures below 0ºC in transited regions such as Al-Ula and Tabouk.

As you may imagine, tourism in Saudi Arabia is in a very embryonic stage.

Random Saudi: Where are you from?

Me: Spain

Random Saudi: Where do you live, in Jeddah or Riyadh?

Me: Nowhere, I am just visiting 🙂

Random Saudi: No, I mean where in Saudi are you working?

I had this conversation over and over. They still don’t know that foreigners can now travel to Saudi Arabia.

When I was exploring the southern part of the country and was walking around the souk with my big backpack, people were asking me if I was carrying a parachute and one even said if it was an inflatable boat.

This was back in 2019, when I visited the southern part of the country. When I came back in 2022, the country had massively changed, so I didn’t really experience any of the above conversations, but that’s partly because I explored the northern part, which is far more developed and receives more international visitors.

Rajal Almaa, a beautiful village in southern Saudi Arabia – T ravel guide to Saudi Arabia

So yeah, the idea of having international visitors who are not expats or workers is still a concept they aren’t familiar with.

However, there is a relatively developed domestic tourism infrastructure, so you can find hotels pretty much everywhere, even though they tend to be expensive.

Moreover, as per things to do, you should know that there are loads, loads of things to do in this country.

Is it ethical to travel to Saudi Arabia?

When I came back from Saudi Arabia, I received many, many messages from very upset people who claimed that traveling to Saudi Arabia implicated collaborating with a regime that doesn’t respect basic human rights.

Some messages were from friendly, skeptical people who wanted a response, while others were from really extreme haters who I blocked right away.

Well, let me tell you something: like in any place around the world, you find good and bad people and, when I travel, I don’t meet with Prime Ministers but I visit places and hang out with humble locals.

This is a very long and controversial topic, so I recommend you read my article:

🔓 How to access blocked sites in Saudi Something you should know is that, in Saudi, the internet is censored. This means that some websites might be blocked and inaccessible for regular internet users. Moreover, because of this censorship and, since there is no freedom of speech, the Government reserves the right to monitor your internet activity. Therefore, if you want to access blocked sites and navigate anonymously, you will need something called a VPN (Virtual Private Network). There are several VPNs in the market but the one I personally use and recommend is ExpressVPN, the fastest and the one that works best for Saudi. GET IT HERE AND GET 3 MONTHS FOR FREE

Heads-up.

Saudi Arabia is the most religious country I have ever been to.

In fact, this is the most religious Muslim country in the world. Everybody knows that.

Most Saudis follow a branch of Islam named Wahhabism, which is characterized for having the most conservative interpretation of Islam and the law of Saudi Arabia strictly follows it.

This means that their penal code includes some very hardcore punishments such as public beheading or getting flogged. This is their country and we are not here to judge and unless you plan to kill someone, smuggle drugs or have sex in public, you shouldn’t be afraid of traveling to Saudi Arabia as a tourist.

Seriously, it is not even close to what you may think.

Saudis prefer to be called Salafis, instead of Wahabis. In their eyes, Wahabism is a few steps ahead than Salafism when it comes to conservatism, meaning that it is really extreme, a term usually used to designate Islamic terrorists. Whereas Salafists are really, really conservative in nature, it is more socially accepted. Thank you, Graham, from Inside Other Places for the clarification

Some rules you need to follow when you travel to Saudi Arabia

Women need to wear an abaya – The abaya is a local dress that covers your body (not your head).

Some public spaces are segregated by sex – You will figure it out by yourself but some restaurants or cafés are still composed of two areas: men and family section. Women or men that go with women need to sit in the family section. This kind of segregation is slowly disappearing, especially in Jeddah and Riyadh.

Depending on where you are, during prayer time, you can’t be inside shops or restaurants – To be honest, this rule has become more flexible but, outside of Riyadh and Jeddah, they kicked me out from shops during the prayers and I could not even stand in front but I had to walk away. A very weird rule.

Don’t drink alcohol – Drinking alcohol in Saudi Arabia is not legal, not even in 5-star hotels.

Seriously, stay away from drugs – Drugs may lead to death sentence, so don’t play with them.

No public shows of affection – Same as when you travel to Dubai or Qatar.

Don’t say you are an atheist – Even if you were, say you are a Christian or any major religion in your home country. Being an atheist can be considered as blasphemy and this is a very serious crime in Saudi. Moreover, you came to Saudi to meet people and make local friends, so saying you are an atheist won’t help you at all.

On Friday, everything is closed until Asr prayer, which is around 4 or 5pm – Not everything will be closed but some restaurants may open in the morning. However, at noon, during Dhuhr prayer, absolutely everything is closed.

Eat with your right hand, always – This is a generic Muslim rule but in Saudi is particularly strict. If you are sharing a meal with more traditional people, try to always eat with your right hand. I am actually left-handed and sometimes I forget about it and Saudi has been the only place where the locals got a bit upset when they saw me eating with my left hand.

Misconceptions about Saudi Arabia – Things you can actually do

Like I said before, in the last couple of years, the laws of Saudi Arabia have become more flexible. Well, this is not entirely right. According to my local Saudi friends, some laws haven’t been changed but the religious Islamic police (mutaween) has lost power, so they aren’t controlling what people do anymore.

Men and women who aren’t family related can hang out together, in public – Some years ago, you couldn’t go to a restaurant or a café with a friend from the opposite sex but now you can do it normally, like in any other country.

Foreign women can travel around the country independently, and alone – I have already lost count of all the women who asked me if they can go there by themselves. Yes, you can travel to Saudi Arabia as a woman, by yourself. Would it be challenging? It would be different from being a man, indeed, but it is definitely legal.

Single foreign women can also visit Saudi on a tourist visa – You can travel to Saudi with your unmarried boyfriend and even if you are single, no problem.

Women don’t need to wear hijab – You don’t need to cover your head but, like I just said, you must cover your body with an abaya. If you travel to Iran, you will see that the clothing rules are even more strict.

Women can drive, including renting a car – From June 2018, women can finally drive and, as a female tourist, you can also rent it.

Men can wear shorts – Nobody will say anything to you.

🕌 The people and the culture – The Saudis

Like in many countries in the Middle East, in Saudi, you find loads of particularly kind people.

Typically, Saudis are so easy to recognize because they wear the thawb, which is the white traditional dress. They also cover their heads with the ghutrah, which can be of different colors but red & white seems to be the most commonly used.

A Saudi man – Can tourists visit Saudi Arabia?

Language in Saudi Arabia

Arabic is the official language. English can be a sometimes problem when you travel in Saudi Arabia, as most people don’t speak it but you will always find someone who does.

Religion in Saudi Arabia

According to the Saudi Government, 100% of the Saudis are Muslim, the large majority being Sunni Wahabbis. There is a large Shia population, as well. Remember that Saudis are very conservative, so try to be respectful and sensitive.

Hospitality in Saudi

Before traveling to Saudi Arabia, I knew a lot of people who had been there on a business visa and the truth is that I am extremely disappointed with all of them because they had told me:

Saudis are arrogant

Saudis are racist to anyone who is not from the Gulf

There is nothing to do in Saudi

Seriously, I don’t know where they have been but, from the moment I met the immigration officer who stamped my passport with a big smile while he tried to improve his Spanish, I have just had positive experiences with Saudi people.

Saudi people are extremely hospitable. From endless coffee and meal invitations to random people who insisted on showing me around the city, I seriously met some incredible locals, some of whom I can call now friends.

Honestly, the experience was no different from the blessings of hospitality in Pakistan, Oman or Iran, no kidding. I shared many short moments with so many locals but there were two Saudis in particular who really changed the perspective of my trip.

First, I met Abdullah, an English teacher from Kharj. He picked me up when I was hitchhiking and drove me to a city that was 80km away (and it was not his way). There, we met with one of his friends, we had lunch at his house and then we visited his camel farm.

Abdullah taught me many interesting things about Saudi culture, especially their interpretation of Islam.

A few days after, I met Ibrahim, a real Saudi from Abha. We met at the souk of Abha and, after having a chat, he invited me to his famous village named Rajal Alma.

We had dinner, stayed at his friend’s house and showed me around on the day after. Ibrahim comes from a very traditional Saudi family (his father was actually a famous Imam from the region) but he married a Filipina girl, something quite unheard of from Saudis with a similar background.

Seriously, don’t trust anyone who has just been to Jeddah or Riyadh for business. First of all, you can’t judge a country by the inhabitants of a several-million people city.

And second of all, don’t trust the judgment from someone who has traveled to Saudi Arabia for business because he hasn’t seen much beyond the office, the fancy restaurant, and the hotel.

Saudis are not happy about how the Western media portraits them

Our media doesn’t really do justice to Saudi people, as they portray them as religious fanatics who force women to submit to their Sharia rules.

The reality is miles away from this stereotype.

Like in any country, there are loads of awesome people and, like in any off the beaten track Muslim country, most of them are extra-nice with foreigners.

Local Saudi women

Most women in Saudi wear the black niqab, which covers the whole face except the eyes.

The reason they wear it is that, according to their interpretation of the Quran, women can’t show their face to any man who isn’t their dad, uncles, grandfathers, sons, and husband, of course.

For years, many pro-feminist groups in Europe have been claiming that the use of niqab is sexist, against the women’s rights and they wear it against their will.

Whereas I fully understand their point, I think that their argument is quite simplistic and it just lets you see one tiny side of the whole picture.

Please note that I am not trying to justify the use of the niqab but I just wanted you to know that many Saudi women actually choose to wear it. Really.

They choose to wear it because they think that this is the right thing to do because the Quran says so. They believe they need to wear it as much as men believe it.

Obviously, there will be many cases of liberal Saudi women who will tell you a different story but I am just talking in generic terms.

My point is that this topic is way more complicated than we think and, as tourists, we shouldn’t be talking or trying to change it because you are traveling to Saudi Arabia to learn about their culture and visit beautiful places.

How to deal with women in Saudi

Now that every day you see more and more women working in public spaces, you are likely to talk to quite a few Saudi women who wear the niqab.

If you are a man, don’t try to shake hands and keep a reasonable distance with them but you can talk to them freely and you will see that they are as lovely women like any other.

If you are a foreign woman, they will definitely be extra nice to you and, if you are on the countryside, expect them to invite you to their house.

When I visited Al-Jawf, 1,000km north of Riyadh, I went there to work on an assignment for a local company and I was very lucky to be received by two super nice ladies wearing niqab. I spent the whole day with them.

They showed me around their province, we went to have some coffee and I even went to their house where they fed me until I exploded. They were as hospitable as any Muslim man I had met before and the only difference is that I didn’t see their faces. It was an enriching experience.

Saudis are multi-ethnic

For centuries, Muslims from all over the world came to Saudi on their journey to Mecca and, at some point, decided to settle there.

Over time, they became Saudi citizens and that is why, today, you find Saudis from all types of ethnicities.

From Bedouin to East-African-looking people and even the cultural-Yemeni-like people from the south of the country, in Jizan, Saudi is the most multi-ethnic Arab country.

For me, this was one of the most surprising things about the country.

People in Fayfa, Saudi Arabia

🍲 Food when visiting Saudi Arabia

The food was another extremely surprising thing about traveling in Saudi.

Before visiting Saudi, I was traveling in Oman for 1 month. In Oman, I felt that, after day 2, I had already tasted all the local food, which was always simplified to different variations of rice with meat, chicken or fish.

Then, I tasted one or two different local dishes in some houses and the rest was all Indian food.

Saudi, however, is a different story. Since it borders with so many Arabic countries, its huge dimensions with many different geographical areas and its multi-ethnic population, the food in Saudi Arabia is a real blend of all the Arabic food you can think of.

From the Yemeni food-like dishes from the south to the olive oil-rich food from the north of the country, Levantine Arabic dishes such as vine leaves and makluba, foul and hummus for breakfast and, of course, the classic Gulf food that includes all sorts of rice with meat, the cuisine of Saudi Arabia also shows the cultural richness of the country.

By the way, traditionally, Saudis eat on the floor and use their right hand to eat. Eating like them is a sign of respect but if you are struggling, you can always help yourself with a spoon.

Since I left Saudi Arabia, I have been bombed with tons of questions from many women who are skeptical about traveling to Saudi.

Sure, Saudi is an extremely patriarchal country, so this kind of reaction is perfectly understandable. However, let me tell you that, as a woman, Saudi Arabia is much safer than you could ever think.

I am perfectly aware that, since I am not a woman, my opinion doesn’t really count here but, luckily, during my journey, I met Nada al Nahdi, a Yemeni / Indonesian girl who was born in Saudi, so she knows the people and culture very well and has traveled around the country extensively.

Nada wrote an article about this topic on my site, so if you want to know more, read:

⚠️ Is it safe to travel to Saudi Arabia?

From a crime perspective, Saudi Arabia is just another very safe place to visit in the Middle East. I mean, you should always be aware of your belongings but pickpocketing or being robbed is quite unheard of.

As per terrorism threat, I will not deny the fact that there have been some one-off terrorist attacks but even UK travel advice says that, except for the areas close to the Yemeni border, all Saudi Arabia is safe to visit.

However, I also went to Jizan, the region bordering Yemen and everything was extra peaceful. The war is happening on the other side of the border, not in Saudi.

In my opinion, the only actual threat when traveling in Saudi Arabia are the extremely crazy drivers. Seriously, after all my years of travels, I can now confirm that Saudi people are the most insane people on wheels.

💰 Money, budget and costs in Saudi Arabia

The Saudi Rial is the official currency and:

1 USD = 3.75 SAR

Exchanging money

Euros, United States dollars or British Pounds are widely accepted. You can even exchange Indian and Pakistani rupees and other Asian currencies, as there is a large Asian population living in Saudi.

Of course, the currencies from other Gulf countries, such as Omani Rials or UAE Dirhams are also accepted.

ATM and credit cards

ATMs are available pretty much everywhere and credit cards are accepted in most modern cafés, restaurants, and hotels. However, bring always some extra cash, as the Indian-run cafés and other more local places don’t accept cards.

How much does it cost to travel in Saudi Arabia?

These are the prices of the most typical things:

Budget Hotel – Double room from 100 to 150SAR

Breakfast in Indian-run café – 5 to 10SAR

Breakfast in local Saudi eatery – 10 to 15SAR

Lunch in Indian-run restaurant – 10 to 15SAR

Lunch in local Saudi eatery – 15 to 20SAR

Lunch in mid-range restaurant – From 30-35SAR

Short taxi ride in Riyadh – 15 to 25SAR

🛺 Transportation: How to move around when visiting in Saudi Arabia

Something you need to know: Saudi Arabia is the least walking-friendly place I have ever been to. That being said, here is what you need to know regarding moving around the Kingdom:

Moving inside cities

Public transportation in Saudi cities is awful and, except in some parts of Jeddah, you must drive with your own car or by taxi. You can’t seriously walk.

If you aren’t self-driving, I recommend you download Uber or Careem, so you won’t have to deal with negotiating a price with a taxi.

Domestic flights

Another problem of Saudi Arabia is that distances are ridiculously huge and the nice places to visit in Saudi are scattered all around the country.

For example, Al-Ula is nearly 1,000km north of Jeddah and Jizan is another 1,000 south of Jeddah. If you are short of time, a very good alternative is taking domestic flights.

I recommend you check on Saudia Airlines, as they have the largest number of domestic connections in the country.

For cheaper flights, check Flyadeal.

Actually, the most effective way to travel in Saudi Arabia would be taking a domestic flight and then renting a car in the destination itself.

Renting a car in Saudi Arabia

Road tripping around Saudi Arabia is the best way to enjoy the country, and I strongly recommend you do that.

Gas is cheap, so are the daily rental rates. However, all companies offer limited daily mileage, around 250-300km a day I think, so if you drive to faraway places like Al-Ula or Jizan, it can get expensive for solo travelers.

By the way, most rental companies won’t rent you a car if you don’t have an international driving license, so remember to convert it before leaving your country.

Some roads in Saudi are insane. This is Tabouk region

Moving around Saudi Arabia by bus

You can also move by bus between cities. They are very cheap but the problem is that you will have to rely on taxis once you get to any destination. There is not a single city in Saudi which is walking friendly.

You check all bus schedules and buy tickets on this website.

Hitchhiking

As crazy as it may sound, I hitchhiked all across Saudi Arabia.

I actually hitchhiked from Riyadh to Jizan, 1,300km. I had some really good experiences but, at the same time, I had not so good experiences.

On the one hand, it is relatively easy to get a ride and, normally, Saudis will be extremely helpful and, if you are lucky, they will invite you to their house.

On the other hand, most places in Saudi are connected with highways where people drive extremely fast and, sometimes, they overtake cars by the shoulder of the road, which is extremely dangerous if you are waiting there.

Moreover, many Saudis are crazy drivers, more than in any other country I have been to. On one occasion, I refused to continue with a man because I was seriously afraid of dying. When I finally reached Jizan, I decided not to hitchhike anymore. It was too intense.

💻 Internet and SIM Card

eSIM for browsing, calling and traveling in Saudi Arabia

Basically, an eSIM is a regular SIM card with a digital format that works like a normal physical SIM card, with the added benefit that you can buy it from home before the beginning of your trip, hence avoiding the hassle of buying it at your destination.

With Holafly, you can get a SIM Card for a wide range of destinations, including Saudi Arabia.

Moreover, you can benefit from a 5% discount with the following code: AGAINSTTHECOMPASS

Connecting to Wi-Fi in Saudi

Saudi is a modern country, with pretty good Wi-Fi in most places.

Getting a SIM Card in Saudi

I got ZAIN which, according to locals, has the worst network but it was the only company I found which you could buy just 1 or 2GB. Mobily is the most popular one but they asked me to buy 10GB, at least, which was around 150SR (40USD). With ZAIN, I think I just paid around 30SR for the SIM Card plus 1GB worth of data.

Remember that, in Saudi, the internet is censored and, if you want to access blocked sites, you will need a VPN.

🏨 Accommodation: where to stay in Saudi In Saudi Arabia, there is plenty of accommodation options. Typically, budget hotels will be apartment-style hotels, which tend to be a very good value-for-money option when you are two people or more. In Jeddah and Riyadh, good but basic apartment-style hotel will start at 50-60USD a night, approximately, while in smaller towns, you can find for 30USD.
