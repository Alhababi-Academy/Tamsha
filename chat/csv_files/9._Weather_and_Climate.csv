The seasons and climate in Saudi,
Climate Change Knowledge Portal,"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia constitutes the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia with a total area of approximately 2.25 million km2 of which about 38% are desert lands. The country is arid, and the sand desert renders several regions susceptible to flooding and desertification. Saudi Arabia’s population is approximately 35 million (2020) people and its economy is heavily dependent on oil. The country is the world’s largest petroleum exporter. Saudi Arabia lacks permanent water resources and, therefore, must depend on groundwater and seawater desalination to meet its water demands. Saudi Arabia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change that pose increasing risk to its water security, such as decrease in frequency and amount of precipitation and increase in temperature."

What is the Weather in Saudi Arabia Like?,"Many people who I meet ask me about the weather in Saudi Arabia and what it’s like. Since Saudi Arabia is a big country, the weather differs from one place to another. There are some mountainous parts that actually get hail storms in the winter season. While others, like my city enjoy a standard GCC weather forecast. This means that it’s mostly very hot and humid in the summer and dry and cold in the winter.

Summer Weather in Saudi Arabia

Basically, we only witness two seasons: summer and winter. In each season, the weather is so extreme that you just can’t wait for it to end! For example, in the summer months, the display windows of the shops get covered in condensation caused by extreme humidity levels! The same trend applies to your glasses. They will be covered in fog to the point that you won’t be able to see through the lenses unless you wipe them with a cloth. Chocolate melts before you can get the pleasure of tasting it, eggs can be cooked in direct sunlight (without the need of an oven or stove!) and the water in non-controlled swimming pools gets too hot for a refreshing swim. Another reason for this humidity is of course the proximity to the Gulf ocean. Wherever you have beaches, you must get some degree of humidity.

Winter Weather in Saudi Arabia

In contrast to the cruel and sticky summer months, we get very cold desert winters. The winter in the Gulf region is unlike the one in Europe or other continents. Since it’s a desert, we get a harsh type of winter. One with a strong wind, dry cold weather and very scarce rain – like maybe once or twice in a year. The temperatures might not drop that low in the winter months, but you must always stay protected and wear suitable clothing. Because the cold winter breeze could penetrate your bones and leave you ill for the rest of the season! I must admit, the winter in Dubai is much warmer than that of my city – Al Khobar. The Dubai winter serves as a respite from the severe summer heat and humidity. It’s a time when the weather in the city is at its best, and we all look forward to Al Fresco dining and finally being able to spend time outdoors..

Clothes for Winter

In Saudi, the winter months are cooler. You do need to cover up (despite us women being covered in an Abaya anyway) properly. The winters in my city were cold enough, that a jacket becomes essential. Sweaters, cardigans or hoodies wouldn’t do the job. So, the need arises for a proper heavy winter jacket. But the challenging part for us women was wearing the jacket under our light fabric Abayas! It was almost impossible to pull that look off and still manage to look cool while out in public! I think during the cold winter months, half of the population looked obese! as if we had all suddenly gained some winter weight or something. It was hilarious and annoying at the same time! I honestly can’t remember how I ended up solving the Abaya and jacket dilemma. I probably just wore heavy sweaters underneath the Abaya or maybe got myself an Abaya with a heavy material. I will definitely update this post if I remember anything about this!

Memories of Weather When Younger

One thing that will never leave my memory is how we used to wear thick tights under our school uniforms as kids! This was back in the 1980’s (when I was in elementary school) and when the winters in my city used to get extremely cold! Who could imagine that in those days, the winter season demanded that we not only wear thick knitted tights to protect our legs from the desert winter, but that we would even warm up those tights on electric heaters that we had in our homes! I still remember those days very clearly. We would wake up so early to go to school, and the maid (nanny/housekeeper) would place our thick white tights on the heater before we could wear them under our uniforms. That feeling of wearing warm tights was the epitome of bliss and pure joy. I’m not lying when I say that I used to wear those tights under my jeans and pants too! that’s how cold it was in those days! One pair of pants wasn’t enough to protect us from the cold breeze. We had to wear thermal underwear and tights at all times! It’s so ironic when you think of how these days, we would be happy just to wear a winter jacket throughout the season. I still have my jackets and coats from my London days – decorating my clothes wardrobe. I would be ecstatic if I got to wear any jacket or coat for at least one day during any given Dubai winter! The problem is, that because I love the winter, I can’t seem to stop myself from buying winter clothes – even if they end up in the closet and never see the day of light.

Saudi Arabia Global Warming

Global warming is starting to visibly impact our region. This summer’s soaring temperatures and high humidity levels reflect this serious climate change. Although I might not be warming up any thick tights – or leggings – on an electric heater this Dubai winter, I know that I will definitely be enjoying the cooler weather while writing from my balcony in the evenings and catching up with friends at the city’s cool outdoor venues."

Weather and climate

Best time to visit

Saudi Arabia has a desert climate characterised by dry, hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is scarce, and sharp temperature changes between day and night should be expected.

Spring (March to June) is warm, though the temperatures at night can dip below 15°C (59°F) in the north, but in the south (particularly around Abhā in the southwest), spring is the rainiest season.

Summer (June to September) is long and hot; it is usual to see the temperature hitting 45°C (113°F). However, the hilly southwest is much cooler.

Autumn (October to November) is still relatively warm with day time temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F), although evenings are pleasant, with temperatures dropping to around 15°C (59°F) in most cities.

Winter (December to March) is the best time to visit Saudi Arabia as the weather is mild with plenty of sunny days and cool nights. It is possible to see snow in the north – you may even be lucky enough to try snow sledging in the mountains around Tabuk.

Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, sits on a rocky plateau in the centre of the country. Its relatively high elevation (594m or 1950ft above sea level) means that it is sunny year-round and less humid than other Saudi cities. July and August are the warmest months with an average temperature of 36°C (97°F). The period between June and September is also dry with no rain at all, while the months between November and April receive about 100mm (4in) of rain.

Jeddah, a major port city on the Red Sea coast, has hot and humid weather. July is the hottest month in Jeddah with an average high of 38°C (100°F) while January is the coolest month with an average high of 28°C (82°F). The city receives very little rain, averaging just 20mm (0.8in) a year. The evenings are mild in Jeddah and they offer opportunities to enjoy the waterfront, the Jeddah Corniche, which features miles of sandy beaches and three swimming bays.

Makkah, also spelt Mecca, is the holiest city in Islam as it was here that the Quran was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. The city sits in a desert valley 86km (53mi) east of Jeddah. Daytime temperatures often hover above 40°C (104°F) between May and September but the evenings are cooler. The weather in January is most pleasant, with an average high of 31°C (88°F) and an average low of 19°C (66°F).

Required clothing

Pack sunscreen, sunglasses and sun hats, and use layers (light sweaters or scarves) for air-conditioned buildings and cooler evenings.

A rain jacket may be required, depending on when and where you are going.

Geography

The largest country in the Arabian Peninsula, Saudi Arabia is bordered to the northwest by Jordan, to the north by Iraq and Kuwait, to the east by the Persian Gulf, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and to the south by Oman and Yemen. To the west lies the Red Sea. Along the Red Sea coast is a narrow coastal plain (Tihamah), which is hot and humid throughout the year. Beyond the plain is a series of hills and mountains, and in the southwest, near Abha, is where you will find Jabal Sawda, the highest point of the Kingdom standing at 3,133m (10,279ft) above sea level.

95% of Saudi Arabia is desert. Rub' Al Khali, meaning the Empty Quarter, occupies 650,000 sq km (250,966 sq mi) in the south-eastern part of the country. This is the largest desert in the Arabian Peninsula and is absolutely beautiful – visitors can expect undulating sand dunes rising from the ground and rolling away to a distant horizon. Another sizable desert is Al Nufud Al Kabir, located near the borders with Iraq and Kuwait. The sand dunes here can be shaped into mounds towering over a hundred meters.



"
The climate and seasons in Saudi Arabia,"The climate in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is surprisingly vast, however with most of the country being a desert-like plateau, weather conditions are usually fairly stable. The main climate differences can be felt between the coastal areas and the interiors. In most of the country, summers are hot and dry; winters are mild, on the other hand, with temperatures dropping at night, and rain can be expected at this time. The Kingdom’s capital, Riyadh, experiences temperamental winters. Warm days turn into frigid nights, and summers are extreme with temperatures peaking at 47 degrees. However, low humidity offers some comfort. In the far north mountains, winters are cold and you might even experience snow. Meanwhile, in the coastal areas around the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, the climate remains warm and sultry all year.

Regional climate averages in Saudi Arabia January is the depth of what passes for winter in Saudi Arabia, however, conditions can vary wildly in different regions. At this time of year, you could find rain and temperatures dropping as low as 6 degrees Celsius during the night in Mada’in Saleh. Meanwhile, Jeddah might experience tropical thunderstorms and balmy days, with temperatures reaching 30 degrees Celsius. A lightning storm over Jeddah Of course, this is the country’s rainy season. Most rainfall occurs between November and April. During this period, the central plateau, including Riyadh, sees a yearly average of 111mm. Meanwhile, drier parts of the country, such as Medina, only receive around 41mm. Summers in Saudi Arabia are unstintingly intense. Average temperatures hover around 40 degrees Celsius, although the barometer has been known to peak at 50 degrees Celsius. The season is also unfailingly dry, with no rain and only moderate humidity. Although the summers are similar to those experienced in neighboring countries such as Oman, Jordan, and Iraq, the winters tend to be warmer. This is due to Saudi Arabia’s geographical location; it is sheltered within the Red Sea and Persian Gulf and therefore does not benefit from the cool coastal breezes that other countries enjoy. Lifestyle The best restaurants in Riyadh to try at least once Read more Although the amount of sunshine doesn’t vary enough between the seasons to warrant daylight saving measures, there are generally longer days in summer and shorter days in winter. Most of the Kingdom receives between 9 and 12 hours of sun each day. In extreme areas, however, this can dip to as little as 7 hours and increase to as much as 14. As you would expect in the desert climate of Saudi Arabia, snowfall is extremely rare here, however, in the very far north of Turaif, and some altitudinous mountain regions, snow is a possibility if conditions are right.

Summer in Saudi Arabia Long and unforgiving Saudi summers are not for the fainthearted. From May onwards, temperatures soar from around 30 degrees Celsius and peak at around 45 degrees in August. There is very little rainfall to cool things down, but thankfully, there isn’t too much humidity, either. What to wear in summer If you are going to brave summers in Saudi Arabia, the trick will be finding a way to cover up and respect the local culture while trying to stay cool. Lightweight clothes in natural fibers are recommended, but you will want to keep a wrap or cardigan handy; air-conditioning can be positively glacial indoors as residents try to beat the heat. Saudi Arabia has very conservative dress codes so to ensure that you are appropriately attired, it is best to remain covered at all times; this applies to both genders, too. Women can only have their faces and hands exposed, so it may be more comfortable to wear light abayas like the locals. While headscarves are technically optional, you may attract negative stares and disapproval if you choose to go without. Attitudes towards footwear, however, are more liberal, so feel free to opt for open-toe styles. Popular summer activities Despite the uncomfortable heat, it is easy to seek relief during the intense summer in Saudi Arabia. Riyadh’s Snow City is popular for activities such as skiing and sledding. Many malls, including Royal, Othaim, and Hayat, also offer ice-skating. In-the-know locals head to swanky hotels like the Marriott Diplomatic Quarter, Luthan Hotel and Spa, and the Burj Rafal to lounge by the pool. If you are looking to escape the city, though, you can rent an istiraha (rest house) with a pool on the city fringes, or venture to the highlands of Al Taif and Al-Madinah. Summers are peak holiday season, so you will have lots of time to enjoy all of these summer activities. The season is bookended by the Eid al-Fitr holiday in June, and Eid al-Adha in August. Before going back to work or school at the end of the summer, residents celebrate Muharram – the Muslim New Year – at the end of August. Find out more about Public holidays in Saudi Arabia.

Winter in Saudi Arabia Winter in Saudi Arabia peaks between December and January, however, it can extend up to a month either side. Average temperatures during the season are a comfortable 20 degrees Celsius, but in certain regions, it can drop closer to zero degrees by night; January is definitely considered the coldest month. Rainfall reaches a high during the winter months, although this can vary in different parts of the country. Generally, the central plateau, including the capital of Riyadh, has the heaviest downpours. Snow is rare, but some areas, such as mountainous Jiraz, Tabuk, or Jabal al-Lawz, can experience a light dusting. What to wear in winter Since temperatures can vary, you will want a range of clothing on hand. Layers are always a good idea so you can add or remove them as the weather demands. T-shirts are usually fine during the daytime, but you may want a light jacket or sweater at night. In the far north or western mountains, down jackets, scarves, and boots will come in useful for battling the more frigid conditions. For women, this is the ideal time to choose thicker abayas (and layer up underneath) and pick thicker scarves to wrap up your hair. Popular winter activities With winter being the most temperate season in Saudi Arabia, this is the perfect time to get outdoors. Many locals choose to use the winter to indulge in desert activities, so head out to Al-Nafud or Rub’ al Khali for horse-riding, sandboarding, and hiking. For those staying in Riyadh, horse-racing at the King Abdulaziz Race Track is a popular weekend pastime. Winters are all about weekend fun since there are no public holidays during the season. Schools close for two weeks in January, though, so many residents choose to take family trips during this time.

Spring in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia doesn’t have much of a spring, but what passes for this transitional season rolls by all too quickly between March and April. Temperatures rise sharply over the two months, hitting the mid-30s by the end of the season. Don’t expect any rain during this time. What to wear in spring With the weather heating up quickly, spring is the time to transition your wardrobe to summer essentials. Put away the jacket and cardigans and break out loose, light shirts and flowy trousers. This is the moment to wear cotton and linen garments. While styles get a little more relaxed during this period, remember to maintain a conservative approach towards how you dress. Popular spring activities Despite its truncated length, spring is festival season in Saudi Arabia and you will find a plethora of events to attend such as the Yanbu Flower Festival (the country’s answer to London’s Chelsea Flower Show), the Riyadh International Book Fair, and multiple golf tournaments at the local links. This is also a great time to head to the desert, visit seasonal lakes like Kharrarah, and hike to the Edge of the World. The Kingdom’s vegetation comes to life in spring, so this is the best time to explore the flora (roses specifically) and fauna in the hills of Ta’if, Madinah, and Jeddah. You may even be able to nose around and find some of the famous Saudi black truffles which come into season during this period.

Autumn in Saudi Arabia Like spring, autumn in Saudi Arabia is short and sweet; usually spanning the months of September and October. Photo: MrcTeamStock/Getty Images From mid-September, the weather begins to cool off, but relief from the intense desert heat only comes in October when daily averages drop to around 26 degrees Celsius. The tiny – almost negligible – rainfall that sometimes occurs during this period also helps take the edge off. What to wear in autumn In terms of clothing, it is advisable to keep things simple and go for the same kind of transitional outfits you would wear during the springtime; i.e., loose, light shirts and flowy trousers, as well as cotton and linen wear. It is also a good idea to keep outer layers handy towards the end of the season. Popular autumn activities This is also a time for celebration in Saudi Arabia. The country hosts several annual events during this period, including the Hala Jeddah Festival. The official National Day – Unification of the Kingdom Day – is held on September 23 every year to celebrate the country’s founding in 1932. Although this is traditionally a quiet observance, the last few years have seen the day take on a more festive atmosphere with fireworks and public acknowledgments."
Climate,"Climate guide to Saudi Arabia

Most of Saudi Arabia has a desert climate, with an intensely hot, dry summer between May and September, and a mild winter between December and March.

Indoor spaces are air-conditioned as standard in Saudi Arabia, including hotels, shops, museums, and vehicles. However, outdoor attractions such as the AlUla archaeological area, the historic district of Al-Turaif, and the Rub' al Khali dunes offer little escape from the sun. As such, the best time to visit Saudi Arabia is during the cooler months of November through to March. This allows you to explore more of the country’s highlights comfortably – though you should always prepare for warm weather and strong sun.

Saudi Arabia has one of the lowest levels of annual rainfall in the world, and much of this is concentrated in the southwest of the country. Most rain falls during winter and spring, helping to quench the desert vegetation before the long, dry summer.

What to wear for Saudi weather

To protect yourself from the desert sun, we recommend wearing sunscreen, sunglasses, loose linen clothes that cover the arms and legs, and a wide-brim hat, cap with neck cover or head scarf.

If you are visiting during the spring, especially in the southwest, you may wish to pack a light raincoat. An additional layer is also advised if you will be outside during the evening, or visiting mountainous regions, as it can get cold.

When to go

What to pack

Saudi Arabia is an Asian country that occupies most of the Arabian Peninsula and is crossed by the Tropic of Cancer. To the west it overlooks the Red Sea and to the east the Persian Gulf. To the west there is a mountain range parallel to the coast, while the interior is largely occupied by a plateau. Only in the south-east is a flat area.In Saudi Arabia, there is almost everywhere a, with an extremely hot summer, which goes from May to September. However, on the plateau it can get cold in winter, especially at night and in the north.In Saudi Arabia, good weather often prevails even in winter, however, in this season, the country is sometimes affected bycoming from the Mediterranean, especially in the center-north, where, every now and then, even a bit of cold air can arrive. Instead, in summer the southern part is marginally affected by thewhich affects nearby Yemen and the Arabian Sea, so much so that in the south-west there is a mountainous area that receives some rain, especially in July and August.Thein Saudi Arabia are very scarce, usually from 50 to 150 millimeters (2 to 6 inches) per year, and are almost everywhere concentrated from November to April, except in the mountains of the south-west, where it can exceed 250 mm (10 in), and as we have said it can rain even in summer.In Saudi Arabia, there are practically noof any importance, but as happens in desert countries, there are many dry riverbeds, called, which can sometimes turn into ephemeral streams after the rains, which although rare, can sometimes be violent.In theclassification, the climate of Saudi Arabia is almost everywhere hot desert (BWh), although the far north approaches the cold desert climate (BWk), while the mountains of the south-west fall into the cold semi-arid climate, or steppe (BSk).Along both the western and eastern coasts of Saudi Arabia, the climate is desert, and it's particularly mild in winter, even warm in the central and southern part of the Red Sea coast, while in summer, it's very hot everywhere, but it's sultry on the shores of the Red Sea, especially in the southern part (see Jizan), and a bit drier, and therefore more torrid, on the shores of the Persian Gulf.In the thin coastal region overlooking the Red Sea, called, winter is mild in the northern part and hot in the central-southern part, while summer is very hot everywhere.The rare rains occur from November to April in the central-northern part, while in the southernmost part (see Jizan), some rain also occurs in summer.Sometimes, the rains can be intense and concentrated in time, to the point that they can causeIn the northern part, winter is mild, in fact, the average in January ranges from 15 °C (59 °F) on the Gulf of Aqaba to 19.5 °C (67 °F) in Al Wajh (or Wejh). In this area, it can sometimes get cold in winter. Here are the average temperatures in Al Wajh.The Red Sea in Al Wajh is warm enough for swimming all year round, although it goes down to 23.5 °C (74 °F) in February and March, while it becomes very warm in summer.In the northernmost part, in the Gulf of Aqaba, it is a bit cool in winter, since it goes down to 21 °C (70 °F) in February and March.Already in the central part, winter is warm, so much so that in Jeddah , the largest city on the Red Sea coast, the average in January is 23.5 °C (74.5 °F). Here are the average temperatures.Even hotter than Jeddah is Mecca , which is not located right on the coast but further east, and is a. At the worst times the temperature can reach 50 °C (122 °F).In the southernmost part of the coast, we find Jizan (or Gizan), which in winter is the hottest city in Saudi Arabia, while in summer it is decidedly muggy. Besides, it is possible that some rain may fall here even in this season, especially in August.In Jizan, and on the Farasan Islands, which lie off the coast, the sea is warm all year round, and exceeds 30 °C (86 °F) from May to October.In the east, on the, the climate is sunny and desert. Winter is mild, but it's cooler than on the Red Sea coast: the average in January is between 12 and 17 °C (54 and 63 °F). Sometimes at night it can get cold, especially in the northern part, near the border with Kuwait, where lows can drop to around freezing (0 °C or 32 °F).Summer is very hot and sunny. However, since the prevailing wind blows from the northwest, originally from the Iraqi desert, and therefore it does not come directly from the sea, the summer is a bit less humid than on the coast of the Red Sea.In the central part of the coast, we find Dammam , and the nearby cities of Dhahran and Khobar. Here are the average temperatures in Dammam.The Persian Gulf, in the central part, is a bit cool from January to March, while it becomes very warm from May to November. In summer, the Persian Gulf becomes the warmest sea in the world, even more so than the Red Sea.In the northernmost part, near the border with Kuwait, the sea in winter is a bit colder, in fact, the temperature drops to 18 °C (64 °F) in February and March. In contrast, in the southernmost part, in the small coastal stretch between Qatar and the Emirates, the sea in winter is a bit warmer, so much so that the water temperature does not go below 23 °C (73 °F).As mentioned, most of the Arabian Peninsula is occupied by a, whose altitude goes between 400 and 1,200 meters (1,300 and 4,000 feet). In addition to the rocky deserts, there is a series of sandy deserts, interrupted by rare oases, and connected to one another, called, and. The latter is the largest, a huge expanse of sand that occupies the south of the country, and is located largely outside the plateau, at a lowland altitude.The plateau,like almost all of Saudi Arabia, has a fairly uniform climate: mild in winter, but with very cool or cold nights, and very hot in summer, but with low humidity. The main differences occur in, when the northern part is much colder than the southern one.In the far north, there is an offshoot of the, which has a desert continental climate, with relatively cold winters, also due to the higher altitude, and hot summers.In this area we find the city of Turaif , which in winter is the coldest in Saudi Arabia. During winter, cold waves can occur: in these cases, the temperature can drop to -6/-8 °C (17/21 °F), and more rarely (given the low precipitation amount) it can even snow. On the contrary, despite the altitude, the temperature in summer can reach 43/45 °C (109/113 °F). Here are the average temperatures in Turaif.Precipitation occurs from November to April and is scarce, while from June to September, basically, it never rains.To the south of the Syrian desert we find the historical plateau of Arabia, called(also spelled Nejd, Neged or Nujd). Although it is milder than the Syrian Desert, in winter, especially in the central-northern part, it can sometimes get cold. In Ha'il , at 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) above sea level, the record is even -10 °C (14 °F). In the long summer, from May to September, the temperature can exceed 45 °C (113 °F).Rainfall, typically lower than 100 mm (4 in) per year, occurs almost all from the end of October to the beginning of May, and is irregular from year to year. Furthermore, given that the rains can sometimes be intense and concentrated in time, even in this area, flash floods can occasionally occur.In the central part of the plateau we find Riyadh , the capital, where it can sometimes get cold on winter nights. Here are the average temperatures.Instead, further west we find Medina , ""The Enlightened City""), which is milder.In the south, the desert of, uninhabited and mysterious, is quite warm even in winter, with highs in January around 25/26 °C (77/79 °F). At night, it can get pretty cool, but temperatures do not drop below freezing. As mentioned, the central-eastern part of the desert is outside the plateau, in fact the altitude ranges from 70 to 300 meters (230 to 1,000 ft), while in the western part it reaches up to 800 meters (2,600 ft).In summer, the southernmost part of this desert is brushed by the south-west monsoon, which brings currents from the Arabian Sea towards India, in fact, some cloud banks may pass over the area, and sometimes, even a rain shower may occur.Very rarely, the Rub 'al Khali desert may be affected by the remains ofcoming from the Arabian Sea, which can bring sand storms, and unusual rains in the middle of the desert, as happened in May 2018 with Cyclone Mekunu. Cyclones form from May to December, and are more frequent at the beginning of the period (May-June) and a little less at the end (October-December).The western part of Saudi Arabia, known as, is crossed by a mountain range parallel to the coast of the Red Sea. In the north (the area circled in green on the map), the climate is desert, with no summer rainfall, though some rains are possible in winter, and even snowfalls at the highest altitudes, as happens in, 2,580 meters (8,465 feet) high, located in the north-west.In the southern part of the mountains, in the Asir, Jizan and Al-Bahah regions (burgundy area), there are several peaks above 2,000 meters (6,500 feet), among which is the highest mountain of Saudi Arabia,, 2,990 meters (9,810 feet) high.In this area, the climate is obviously tempered by altitude, in addition, in summer, especially in the southern part,may occur.Some rain may fall also in spring, between March and May. In some areas, precipitation exceeds 250 mm (10 in) per year, so the climate is semi-arid rather than desert. On the southwest-facing slopes, there are verdant landscapes and terraces, where water springs are used for irrigation.In July and August, Abha , located near the Asir National Park, at 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) above sea level, is the mildest city in Saudi Arabia, with highs around 30 °C (86 °F). Here are the average temperatures.In much of Saudi Arabia, either in the areas where the winter is mild (ie the northern part of the Red Sea coast, the central plateau, where Riyadh and Medina are located, and the coast of the Persian Gulf) or where the winter is warmer (ie Mecca, Jeddah, the south-central part of the Red Sea Coast and the Rub 'al Khali), the best time is, since in this way you can avoid the heat, which can be intense in the rest of the year (but especially in summer).However, in the northern areas, north of Riyadh (see Ha'il, Rafha, Tabuk) you can avoid the winter, which can be cold, and choose the months of. In the far north, in the Syrian desert (see Turayf, Al Qurayyat) where the winter is longer, you can choose April and October.In, in July and August, the only areas where the heat is bearable are the mountains, in particular, in Abha and Asir, where however, rain and thunderstorms can occur.For, the best month in the Persian Gulf is November (in March the sea is still a bit cool, while in April it starts to get hot). In the central-northern part of the Red Sea you can go in March and November, while in the central-southern part, from Jeddah down to the border with Yemen, you can go from November to March, because in those parts both the sea and the weather are warm even in winter.In summer, even though the sea is very warm, it's too hot for sunbathing.In: in the Syrian desert, bring warm clothes, such as a down jacket, a hat, a raincoat or umbrella, and a scarf.In the Persian Gulf coast, bring spring/autumn clothes, a T-shirt for warm days, a sweater and a jacket for the central and southern parts (see Dammam, Al Khobar), a heavier jacket and a hat for the northern part (see Khafji), a scarf for the wind, and possibly an umbrella.For the Red Sea coast, north of Jeddah, light clothes for the day, a sweater and a light jacket for the evening, which sometimes can also be used in Jeddah and Mecca. In the southern part (see Jizan), in addition to light clothes, you just need a scarf for the breeze and possibly a light sweatshirt for the evening.For the plateau, Riyadh and Medina, spring/autumn clothes, a warm jacket and a hat for the evening, especially in the north. For the Rub 'al Khali, light clothes for the day, a scarf or turban, desert boots or sandals, and a sweater or jacket for the evening and early morning.For the western mountains, in the north, warm clothes, such as a down jacket and sweater; in the south, spring/autumn clothes (light for the day), a sun hat, a sweater and a jacket for the evening.In: for the Syrian desert and the plateau above 700 meters (2,300 feet, see Ha'il), bring light clothes, a sun hat, a sweatshirt or sweater for outdoor evenings, and a scarf.For Mecca, the plateau and Riyadh, the Rub 'al Khali and the coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, lightweight clothes, long and made of natural fabric (cotton or linen), a desert turban; a sweatshirt and a scarf for air conditioned places.For the western mountains, light clothes for the day, a sun hat or desert turban, a sweatshirt or sweater for the evening, hiking shoes; for the southern part, you can add a raincoat or umbrella.should cover their entire body except for their face and hands.See also the temperatures month by month"

UND Atmospheric Sciences team spends spent six weeks overseas, conducting weather-modification research

By Averie Eixenberger

This past October and November, members of the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences spent six weeks in Saudi Arabia for a research trip involving weather modification.

This research project was done in collaboration with The National Center for Meteorology in Saudi Arabia. The goal was to observe the differences between seeded and non-seeded clouds to show the effects of the seeding agent used in weather modification.

“Our overall goal was to study developing convective clouds,” said Lynnlee Rosolino, a UND graduate student. “We looked at the environment in which the clouds develop, including temperature, dewpoint and pressure, among other things; but we focused mostly on the microphysics within the clouds. The cloud droplets’ shape and size, the concentration of droplets and the state of the droplets are some of the things our instruments can measure that help us better understand the storm.”

Cloud seeding is used to change the type or amount of precipitation that falls from a storm. This type of weather modification involves aircraft flying into clouds to disperse the agent responsible for changing the precipitation.

“It was eye-opening to see the way different countries go about their research,” Rosolino said. “It was also interesting to experience a different culture from a scientific perspective, rather than as a tourist. You get to see a completely different side of the country.”

The trip involved UND faculty members David Delene, research professor of Atmospheric Sciences, and Marwa Majdi, research assistant professor of Atmospheric Sciences, as well as Atmospheric Sciences staff member Andrea Neumann-Skow and graduate students Rosolino and and Michael Willette. The team spent weeks gathering data from in-cloud observations at different temperatures.

“I loved being in the plane flying through the clouds,” said Rosolino. “It’s really cool being able to experience weather from inside the storm as it’s developing.”

The data collected by the team will continue to be analyzed by the UND Atmospheric Sciences department and the Saudi Arabian National Center for Meteorology. The goal is to verify the effectiveness of cloud seeding on the weather.

“We had a lot of fun,” said Rosolino. “We got to joke around and laugh while flying between the clouds. Then we turn on the science brain and learn a lot while gaining work experience in the field.”

Climatic conditions in Saudi Arabia,"Seasons in Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia has mainly two seasons: Summer and Winter.

Rainfall is low in the country, especially in the central region. Here, normally, a change in season is preceded by a rain or sand storm. The dusty season usually takes around 40 days to conclude with the sand storm hitting then letting up every few days.

In the southwestern coastal areas it rains quite regularly with high humidity in the summer, but there is very little rainfall in the capital city of Riyadh and the northern parts of the Red Sea coast. Even though, heavy rains sometimes occur in different parts of the country including Riyadh that cause serious short-lived floods.

The peak winter in Saudi Arabia falls during the months of December and January while peak summer hits during June and July.

From May to September, daytime temperature reaches 45°C or higher throughout the country except Taif, Al Baha and Asir areas where slightly cooler temperature prevails.

In the peak winter, temperatures in the main cities (except Jeddah), drops considerably during the day and even hit zero during night (especially in the central region). During winter, the mountains can also be shrouded in fog.

Tabuk is the only location in Saudi Arabia where it snows during peak winter.

In the desert

During peak winter (December-January): The breadth of temperature between day and night in the desert is very important. At night, temperature usually drops quite radically and is often well below zero degrees.

February-May & November: It is neither too cold nor too hot. It is rather moderate climate and there is no great difference in temperature between days and nights.

During peak Summer (June-July): Too hot. Temperature during the night is hot.

August-October: It is rather hot during the day. Evenings are warmer."
