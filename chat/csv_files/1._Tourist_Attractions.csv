Exploring Jeddah’s spectacular Red Sea coast,"The Red Sea of Jeddah is home to a wide diversity of marine life, with a colorful reef and lots of species to see: turtles, whale sharks, brightly colored corals and many kinds of fish. Made popular in part by French explorer Jean-Jacques Cousteau in the 1960s, the Red Sea has been a crucial part of the lifestyle of Saudi Arabia’s coastal communities. It’s warm, salty and protected from outside water influences. It’s an oasis for reefs full of biodiversity.

What also makes the location so special is its convenience, as coral can be found all along the coast of Jeddah. There are both shallow waters as well as very deep ones, so scuba and free divers can find exactly the kind of location they want.

“You can take a boat and dive literally anywhere you like, anywhere,” said Nada Alrasheed, professional diver. “Because you’ve got coral all along the coast of Jeddah. There’s an immediate drop off here and divers can find shallow depths to very deep ones.”

The view underwater is magnificent for snorkelers and scuba divers alike, and includes a diverse cast of marine creatures. The two-banded clownfish is often accompanied by symbiotic anemones that protect it from predators. The clownfish is easy to find, especially during snorkeling sessions at Sharm Obhur, north of Jeddah. The scorpionfish with tassel is able to camouflage itself and is a spiny textured fish. It’s one of the most poisonous in the world.

The blue-spotted stingray is distinguished by its electric blue spots. They frequent the seabed near coral reefs and wreck-rich sites such as Abu Tair. The giant wrasse is dubbed either the ”king of the reefs” or the Napoleon. Its beauty is enhanced by the diagonal black lines running from their eyes, reminiscent of eyelashes. These bulbous creatures can reach 1.82 m and 200 kg. The green sea turtle has been endangered for along while. Without pressures from predators or humans, they live to be over a hundred years old.

In the Red Sea, sharks are best seen at remote sites in the open sea. Several species venture into these waters, but one stands out from the rest: the silky sharks. Some people even snorkel near them. Sharks are extremely important to life underwater, and some scientists have dubbed them “the doctors of the ocean”. They help keep an equilibrium in the ecosystem by preying on the weak or unhealthy, whose genes won’t be passed on to the next generation.

“It’s always important to look around, sharks are predators and we’re in their habitat,” said Nada Alrasheed. “It’s OK to swim near them, but we have to be careful, aware and always look right and left. Always keep an eye on the shark.”

There are around 20% of unique and rare fish in the Red Sea. Around 300 different types of coral have been identified in the extensive network of reefs, plus close to 1200 species of fish.

Scientists from the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology have formed a collaboration with planners from The Red Sea Development Company, the developer of luxury tourist destination The Red Sea Project, to protect the Red Sea and its coastline during the construction of this huge eco-tourism project."

The 8 BEST Things To Do in Jeddah (2025),"As you may know, Saudi Arabia has been opening its doors to the world, and if you are the kind of traveller who’s always on the lookout for the next adventure and the next “it” spot, then Jeddah should be on your list.

This vibrant city on the Red Sea is a proper melting pot of history, culture, and modernity that often gets overlooked due to some misconceptions about the country. But trust me, Saudi Arabia is changing fast, and Jeddah is becoming a hub for tourists eager to experience its unique blend of the old and the new. From ancient souks to futuristic skyscrapers, Jeddah offers a bit of something for just about everyone.

So, pack your backpack, grab your camera, and get ready to discover the top things to do in Jeddah. This city is a treasure trove of experiences that will leave you with memories to last a lifetime. From wandering through ancient markets to diving in the crystal-clear waters of the Red Sea, there’s so much to see and do in Jeddah. Let’s dive into the top 8 things you absolutely cannot miss while you’re here.

The Broke Backpacker is supported by you. Clicking through our links may earn us a small affiliate commission, and that's what allows us to keep producing free content 🙂 Learn more.

Top 8 Things To Do in Jeddah

Before we dive into the things to do in Jeddah, let’s quickly reflect on how to get there. Most major international airports now offer flights to either Riad or Jeddah. As for which airline to use, you can of course shop around but our recommendation is that using Saudi Airlines with cleartrip is a good place to start your search.

1. Wander Through Al-Balad

Walking through Al-Balad, Jeddah’s historic district, is akin to stepping into a time machine. This UNESCO World Heritage site is absolutely packed with traditional Hijazi architecture, with old coral-stone buildings that have stood the test of time.

As you stroll along the narrow alleyways, you’ll encounter bustling souks, ancient mosques, and homes that date back hundreds of years. The best time to visit is late afternoon when the heat starts to subside, and the whole area springs to life. Entry is free, but if you want to delve deeper then we suggest you consider hiring a local guide for about $20 to $30.

2. Visit the King Fahd Fountain

You simply can’t go to Jeddah without catching a glimpse of the King Fahd Fountain, the tallest of its kind in the whole world. Shooting water up to 312 metres high into the sky, this iconic landmark is visible from all across the city.

The best views are at sunset or after dark when the fountain is beautifully lit. It’s free to see, and there are plenty of spots along the Corniche where you can sit and catch the spectacle. If you are after the perfect Insta shot, head to the Corniche’s north side.

3. Dive in the Red Sea

If you’re even vaguely interested in diving, then Jeddah’s stretch of the Red Sea coast is not to be missed. With warm, clear waters and vibrant coral reefs, this is one of the best places to snorkel or scuba dive in the world. A spot of Red Sea diving is one the best things to do in Saudi Arabia.

Near the Red Sea, you can expect to see everything from colourful fish to shipwrecks and maybe even the occasional drowned Pharaoh. There are plenty of dive shops along the coast too where you can rent out some gear or book a trip.

A single dive costs around $50 to $100, depending on the operator and equipment. Even if you’re a novice beginner, there are plenty of options to get certified here.

4. Explore the Jeddah Corniche

Stretching for miles along the Red Sea, the Jeddah Corniche is the city’s most popular hangout spot. With its beautiful parks, hip art installations, and beach areas, it’s a classic spot for a leisurely stroll or a family picnic. There are also plenty of cafes and restaurants where you can grab a bite to eat.

The Corniche is especially stunning at sunset, so make sure to have your camera ready. Best of all though it’s free to enjoy. However, you might want to budget for snacks or a meal at one of the local eateries.

5. Shop at the Souk Al-Alawi

No trip to Jeddah is complete without a spot of shopping at Souk Al-Alawi. This bustling market is one of the oldest in the city and is a great place to pick up some souvenirs, spices, and traditional Saudi goods.

The souk is a sensory overload with the omnipresent scent of frankincense, the sounds of haggling, and the vibrant colours of the textiles and jewellery. Bargaining is expected, so don’t be afraid to haggle hard to bag a good deal. Prices do vary, but you can find some great bargains if you’re willing to put in the effort.

6. Visit the Floating Mosque

The Al Rahma Mosque, better known as the Floating Mosque, is another Jeddah must-see. Located on the northern tip of the Jeddah Corniche, this stunning mosque appears to float on the Red Sea at high tide. It’s a popular spot for both worshippers and tourists, and it’s especially beautiful at sunrise or sunset.

Entry is free, and while non-Muslims aren’t allowed inside the prayer hall, you can still admire the mosque’s beautiful architecture from the outside and take some fantastic photos.

7. Check Out the Jeddah Art Scene

It may surprise you to learn that Jeddah is a city that loves art, and nowhere is this more evident than in the city’s many galleries and public installations. The Athr Gallery is a great place to start, showcasing contemporary art from both local and international artists. The city also boasts a vibrant street art scene, with colourful murals and sculptures dotted all around the city, particularly in the Al-Balad district and along the Corniche.

Entry to most galleries is actually free, but you may want to budget a few $5 and $10 for those special exhibitions.

8. Eat Your Way Through Jeddah

Jeddah is a foodie’s paradise, with a culinary scene that reflects the city’s diverse population. From traditional Saudi dishes to international cuisine, there’s something to satisfy every palate (except maybe for the pork fiends out there…there is none of that here).

Don’t miss out on trying local favourites like Kabsa, a spiced rice dish with meat, or Al Baik, the city’s famous fried chicken chain. For a more upscale experience go and check out one of the many seafood restaurants along the Corniche. Expect to spend around $10 to $30 per meal, depending on where you go. Even if you are only visiting Jeddah on a long layover its worth coming out for a bit of food.

Final Thoughts

And there we have it. As you can, Jeddah is a city that defies expectations. It’s a place where ancient history meets modernity, where tradition blends seamlessly with innovation. Whether you’re exploring the historic streets of Al-Balad, marvelling at the King Fahd Fountain, or diving into the crystal-clear waters of the Red Sea, Jeddah offers a rich tapestry of experiences that are as diverse as they are unforgettable.

So what are you waiting for? Jeddah is ready to welcome you with open arms. Whether you’re a seasoned traveller or new to the world of adventure, this city has something to offer everyone. Book your trip, dive into the culture, and let Jeddah surprise you in the best way possible.

See you on the road guys….Enshallah!

Climate and seasons

Spring

Mid-March to Mid-June

Spring in Saudi Arabia can be brisk, particularly in the north, where the temperature at night can drop below 15 degrees C. The central and southern regions are warmer, averaging around 20 degrees after night fall. Rainfall is at its highest during spring, particularly in the central region and in the south west over the Aseer mountains. Don’t forget to pack layers-like light sweaters scarves or pashminas- plus a

rain jacket and sunglasses.

Summer

Mid-June to Mid-September

With the exception of the comparatively mild highlands in the southwest, summer signals the start of the rising temperatures across most of the country, with the average hovering around 45 degrees C. The early mornings and long evenings are more temperature, so take advantage of the warm seas to explore Saudi’s world class Scuba diving sites, or try sailing and snorkelling.

Don’t forget to pack sun cream, lip balm, sunglasses, water shoes, and a hat to protect your face.

Autumn

Autumn brings gentler weather and cool breezes in both Saudi Arabia’s northern region and the south western highlands. While daytime temperatures remain warm and can reach the 30’s in early fall, evenings are milder and fit for outdoor strolling, especially along cool desert springs.

Don’t forget to pack your walking shoes and sweater for air conditioned buildings and cooler evenings.

Winter

Take advantage of Saudi Arabia’s beautiful winter weather to explore the Kingdom. The balmy days and cool nights are ideal for camping, rock climbing or exploring Saudi Arabia’s verdant highlands and bustling cities, from Riyadh to Jeddah. Average winter temperatures are in the teens but visitors might be lucky enough to see snowfall and desert sands.

Don’t forget to pack a heavy jacket or coat as well as location as Saudi Winters can be dry.

Alcohol & substances

The sale, purchase and consumption of alcohol and drugs is illegal in Saudi Arabia.

Health

The Saudi Ministryof Health has a dedicated mobile App, Mawid which offers current health care recommendations, as well as a hotline available at 937.

Essential food and drink

Mezze; Truly one of the joys of Arab world cooking and similar in conception to Spanish Tapas, with infinite possibilities.

Fuul: Mashed Fava beans served with olive oil and often eaten for breakfast.

Shawarma: Ubiquitous kebab- or souvlaki style pita sandwich stuffed with meat.

Baby Camel: Among the tenderness of Saudi meats it’s a particular speciality of Jeddah and the Hejaz.

Red Sea seafood: Fresh and varied and at its best when slow cooked over coals or baked in the oven, try samak mashwi (fish basted in a date puree and barbecued over hot coals).

Khouzi: A bedouin dish of lamb stuffed with rice, nuts, onions, sultanas, spices, eggs, and a whole chicken.

Offices working hours;

0800 to 1800 (or less commonly) 0700 -1900 with a long break. By law the working hours’ week is 48 hours’ maximum and in the month of fasting in Ramadhan 30 hours per week.

DO’S AND DON’T’S:

Taking a Siesta: If the job allows follow local practice by eating your main meal at lunch time and taking a nap in the heat of the day. Drink plenty of water so you don’t become dehydrated. Wear cotton clothing, wear a hat and sunglasses.

Breaking the law in the Arabian Peninsula can have a severe consequence for westerners. Do not take photograph without permission. This is the case when photographing people, particularly women. You should also avoid military or strategic (such as airport and bus stop).

Greetings: shake hands readily with men but wait for an Arab woman to proffer her hand first. Don’t be surprised if people touch their heart after a greeting (as in Saudi) kisses on the cheek are exchanged between men (as in the gulf states).

Don’t enter a mosque during prayer times unless you are a Muslim. Don’t extend your feet in front of you while sitting: tuck them underneath in a slouched kneeling position.

Carry cash: Whether it’s for unexpected stops in rural villages or snack stops at road side stalls, carry enough cash to see you through between ATM visits and in case of emergencies.

Credit cards are accepted everywhere and ATMS are available easily.

However, the invention of the telescope was required before astronomy was able to develop into a modern science.

Eco tourism in saudi arabia on the rise

Saudi Arabia, once synonymous with oil, is now charting a new path toward a sustainable future through a series of remarkable eco-tourism efforts. At the heart of the transformation is vision 2030: an ambitious plan to decrease the country’s oil dependence in part by increasing tourism to account for 10 percent of Saudi’s gross domestic product by 2030, up from 3 percent today. The vision outlines a plan for heightened sustainability efforts nationwide, from large-scale “giga-project” developments to a massive tree-planting campaign.

The red sea project

The luxury tourism development project spans an archipelago of 90 Islands on Saudi’s coast and the shores of the Tabuk province. The giga-project, announced in 2017, is meant to attract international tourism to these unspoiled Islands, create up to 70,000 jobs, and protect the eco system on the Red Sea Coastline.

Red sea project timeline

Phase 1, which includes developing 5 Islands and two inland locations with 16 hotels offering about 3,000 rooms, is due to be completed and welcoming guests in 2024, with the entire project slated to be finished by 2030.

The neom project

The word NEOM translates to “new future”, and that’s exactly what this sprawling project in the Tabuk region aims to achieve, and in a sustainable fashion. A centre piece of Vision 2030 led by His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince and Chairman of the Board of directors of NEOM, this innovation hub-meets-living laboratory is another one of Saudi’s giga-projects. It will include smart towns and cities, research areas, enterprise zones, and entertainment spots. The project’s mission is to attract more than 1 million residents as well as tourists from around the world. In NEOM they address the greatest challenges facing humanity, by attracting elite minds and the best talents around the world, to build a committed society. We are facing a mission to redefine the future now, so the investment doors are open today in NEOM.

Riyadh Season – Entertainment Extraordinaire,"When you think of Saudi Arabia, what comes to mind? For many, it might be vast deserts, oil fields, or conservative traditions. But in recent years, the Kingdom has been undergoing a dramatic transformation, and nowhere is this more evident than in the heart of its capital during Riyadh Season.

What is Riyadh Season?

Riyadh Season is an annual festival that has taken the Saudi capital by storm since its inception in 2019. Part of the larger Saudi Seasons initiative, this months-long extravaganza transforms Riyadh into a vibrant hub of entertainment, culture, and tourism. It’s not just an event; it’s a statement – a bold declaration of Saudi Arabia’s vision for a more open, diverse, and economically varied future.

The Scale of the Spectacle

To call Riyadh Season “big” would be an understatement. We are talking about a festival that spans several months, encompasses multiple zones across the city, and offers hundreds of events and activities. From international concerts and sporting events to local cultural showcases and culinary experiences, the scale is truly mind-boggling.

In 2022, Riyadh Season attracted over 15 million visitors and created more than 150,000 seasonal jobs. The economic impact is significant, contributing billions of riyals to the local economy and putting Riyadh on the global map as a tourist destination.

Zones and Attractions

One of the most exciting aspects of Riyadh Season is its division into themed zones, each offering a unique experience (and here are just some examples – so far we know of 14 this year but there are more coming):

Boulevard City: The festival’s flagship zone, featuring restaurants, cafes, high-end shops, and a dancing fountain. Boulevard World: Take a trip through several countries with culinary delights and fun for the whole family Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams – for the first time ever in Saudi it will show 500 couture dresses VIA Riyadh: A luxury shopping and dining destination. Wonder Garden: A magical garden themed amusement park Al Suwaidi Park: a festival that will take you through 8 countries and 8 cultures such as India, Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt etc Boulevard Runway: expected to open mid December this will be one of the biggest attractions this year: 4 planes converted into restaurants and cafes

These are just a few examples – more is to come and being announced throughout the season which runs from October 12th, 2024 until March 25th, 2025.

Cultural Fusion

What makes Riyadh Season truly special is its blend of international entertainment with local Saudi culture. You might find yourself watching a K-pop concert one day and exploring traditional Saudi crafts the next. This cultural fusion is intentional, aimed at showcasing Saudi Arabia’s heritage while also demonstrating its openness to global influences.

For example, the Al-Murabba zone celebrates Saudi heritage with its traditional architecture, artisanal markets, and folkloric performances. Meanwhile, international stars like Pitbull, Mariah Carey, and Andrea Bocelli have graced Riyadh Season’s stages, bringing global entertainment to Saudi audiences.

Culinary Delights

Food lovers, rejoice! Riyadh Season is a gastronomic adventure. From Michelin-starred chefs setting up pop-up restaurants to food trucks serving local street food, the variety is astounding. You can sample cuisines from around the world or dive deep into Saudi culinary traditions.

The festival has also become a launchpad for many international restaurant brands entering the Saudi market, further diversifying the Kingdom’s culinary scene.

Sports and Entertainment

Sports play a big role in Riyadh Season, with events ranging from WWE matches to Formula E races. The Riyadh Season Cup, a football tournament featuring international clubs, has become a major draw. In 2022, the festival even hosted a match between Paris Saint-Germain and a combined Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr team, featuring global superstars like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

This year we are seeing world renowned boxers return as well as tennis legends taking to the stage in the Six Kings Slam Tennis which featured in the past Djokovich, Nadal and many more top tennis players.

Beyond sports, entertainment options abound. Cirque du Soleil performances, international art exhibitions, and immersive experiences like the “Wonder Garden” light show keep visitors enthralled.

You can find the full list here. Tickets should be pre-booked via the WeBook app here.

Economic Impact and Vision 2030

Riyadh Season isn’t just about fun and games – it is a key part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, an ambitious plan to diversify the Kingdom’s economy away from oil dependence. By boosting tourism, creating jobs, and attracting international investment, the festival plays a crucial role in this economic transformation.

The event has spurred development across Riyadh, from new hotels and restaurants to improved infrastructure. It is also providing opportunities for Saudi entrepreneurs and small businesses to showcase their products and services to a global audience.

Additionally, while Riyadh Season represents a significant opening up of Saudi society, some critics argue that it’s a superficial change that doesn’t address deeper issues of human rights and personal freedoms in the Kingdom.

As Riyadh Season continues to evolve, it’s clear that it’s more than just a festival – it’s a showcase of Saudi Arabia’s ambitions and a testing ground for its vision of the future. Each year brings new attractions, bigger stars, and more ambitious projects.

From an international standpoint, Riyadh Season offers a unique window into the changing face of Saudi Arabia. It’s challenging preconceptions and inviting the world to see a different side of the Kingdom – one that’s vibrant, diverse, and open to new experiences.

For businesses and investors, the festival presents opportunities to enter or expand in the Saudi market. For tourists, it’s a chance to experience a destination that was largely closed off to international visitors just a few years ago.

Riyadh Season is more than just a festival – it’s a symbol of Saudi Arabia’s ambitious plans for the future. It represents a seismic shift in the Kingdom’s approach to entertainment, tourism, and international engagement.

Whether you’re a culture enthusiast, a foodie, a sports fan, or simply curious about the changing face of Saudi Arabia, Riyadh Season offers something for everyone. It’s a testament to the power of entertainment to bridge cultures and change perceptions.

The Red Sea Project: Pioneering Sustainable Luxury Tourism in Saudi Arabia,"The Red Sea Project is one of the most ambitious tourism and development initiatives ever undertaken. Spanning 28,000 square kilometers along Saudi Arabia's western coastline, this project is set to redefine luxury travel by seamlessly integrating sustainability with high-end tourism. Spearheaded by Red Sea Global (formerly The Red Sea Development Company), this initiative is a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, aiming to diversify the economy and establish the Kingdom as a premier global tourist destination. This article delves into the various facets of the Red Sea Project, exploring its sustainable development practices, innovative design features, and the overall impact on tourism and the environment.





Red Sea Project Overview

Scale and Scope

Covering an area larger than Belgium, the Red Sea Project is designed to be a regenerative tourism destination. The development encompasses over 90 pristine natural islands, dormant volcanoes, sweeping desert dunes, lush mountains, wadis, and more than 1,600 cultural heritage sites. Despite its vast scale, less than one percent of the area will be developed, ensuring that the natural beauty and biodiversity are preserved.





Key Components

Luxury Resorts and Hotels: The project includes the development of 50 resorts, featuring up to 8,000 hotel rooms and over 1,300 residential properties. Notable names like Six Senses, St. Regis, and Ritz-Carlton Reserve are part of this luxurious portfolio, promising unparalleled guest experiences. Sustainable Infrastructure: The development of infrastructure is geared towards sustainability. The Red Sea International Airport, set to be fully operational by 2025, will be powered entirely by renewable energy. Ecological Preservation: Only five islands will be developed, with the remaining islands protected as marine sanctuaries to safeguard their ecosystems. This approach is designed to minimize the environmental footprint and promote biodiversity.

Sustainable Design and Practices

Renewable Energy

A cornerstone of the Red Sea Project’s sustainability efforts is its commitment to renewable energy. The entire destination will be powered by renewable sources, primarily solar and wind energy. This initiative not only reduces the carbon footprint but also sets a benchmark for future developments in the region.





Waste Management

Innovative waste management systems are being implemented to ensure zero waste-to-landfill. The project includes state-of-the-art recycling facilities and waste treatment plants designed to convert waste into energy, further reducing environmental impact.





Water Conservation

Given the arid climate of the region, water conservation is a critical component of the project. Advanced desalination plants, powered by renewable energy, will provide fresh water, while greywater recycling systems will ensure efficient water use throughout the resorts and residential areas.





Marine and Terrestrial Biodiversity

The Red Sea Project emphasizes the preservation of marine and terrestrial biodiversity. Marine biologists and environmental experts are actively involved in monitoring and protecting coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass meadows. On land, efforts are made to preserve native flora and fauna, ensuring that the natural habitats remain undisturbed.

Innovative Design Features

Architectural Excellence

The architectural designs within the Red Sea Project aim to blend seamlessly with the natural landscape. The use of locally sourced materials and traditional design elements ensures that the developments are in harmony with their surroundings. The architecture also incorporates passive cooling and natural ventilation techniques, reducing the need for artificial climate control.





Smart Technologies

Smart technologies are integral to the Red Sea Project, enhancing both sustainability and guest experience. Smart grids, automated lighting, and climate control systems optimize energy use, while advanced security and communication systems ensure a seamless and safe environment for visitors.





Economic and Social Impact

Job Creation

The project is expected to create approximately 70,000 new jobs, significantly boosting the local economy. These jobs will range from construction and hospitality to environmental management and research, providing diverse opportunities for the local workforce.





Community Engagement

Engaging with local communities is a priority for Red Sea Global. The project includes initiatives to support local businesses, promote cultural heritage, and provide educational and training programs. These efforts aim to ensure that the benefits of the project are shared with the local population, fostering sustainable development and social well-being.

Challenges and Future Prospects

Environmental Concerns

While the Red Sea Project sets a high standard for sustainable development, it also faces challenges. The delicate balance between development and environmental preservation requires constant vigilance and adaptive management. Ongoing research and monitoring are essential to mitigate any potential negative impacts.





Global Tourism Trends

The success of the Red Sea Project will also depend on global tourism trends. As the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing demand for eco-friendly and health-focused travel experiences. The Red Sea Project’s emphasis on sustainability and luxury positions it well to attract discerning travelers seeking unique and responsible tourism options.





Conclusion

The Red Sea Project represents a bold vision for the future of tourism in Saudi Arabia and beyond. By integrating luxury with sustainability, it sets a new benchmark for responsible development. As the project progresses, it promises to deliver unparalleled experiences while preserving the natural beauty and cultural heritage of the region. This innovative approach not only supports the goals of Vision 2030 but also offers a model for future developments worldwide.

The Red Sea Project: A Luxury Resort Destination in Saudi Arabia,"The Red Sea Project is one of the most ambitious tourism development projects underway in Saudi Arabia, and possibly the world, today. Announced to the public in 2017, the hospitality project covers a remarkable 28,000 km2 of land and water. To put it into perspective, this project covers an area larger than the U.S. state of West Virginia or the country of Belize, and just shy of the size of Belgium. The development includes 90 virgin islands in the Red Sea off the northwest coast of Saudi Arabia, and the $20 billion USD investment is set to develop a regenerative luxury tourism destination with sustainability at its core. 75% of the islands will remain untouched and protected. Once completed, the hospitality project which will become home to over 50 luxury hotel groups which will be 100% powered by renewable energy sources.

The Red Sea Project is ambitious on many levels. First, the sheer size of the project is hard to wrap your head around. This is an area roughly equivalent to the combination of the Bahamas, French Polynesia, Réunion, Seychelles, Mauritius, Trinidad & Tobago, and the Maldives put together. In this gigantic area, it seems to have it all: a pristine archipelago of 90 virgin islands, teeming with coral and sea life, spectacular mountains, rolling dunes and even dormant volcanoes. Of the 90 virgin white-sand islands in the area, only 20 or so will be developed upon, largely to protect marine life, most especially the hawksbill turtle that nests there.

The Red Sea Project is the largest tourism development project underway today in the world, and it aspires to bring barefoot luxury to 80% of the world’s population within 8 hours of travel. The masterplan for the Red Sea Project was approved in 2018, and by 2020 over $2 billion USD of contracts were already awarded. The entire project is expected to cost over $20 billion USD. Today, significant works are being completed by 10,000 workers on-site. Phase One of the project will see the construction of 16 luxury hotels built across five islands, and two inland resorts, providing more than 3000 hotel keys. Today, much construction is underway. Sheybara and Shaura Islands are among the first islands to be developed upon, along with a beautiful new Red Sea Airport, the Southern Dunes development, a Coastal Village, Turtle Bay Hotel, and the Coral Bloom development, to name a few. Connecting it all are 80km of paved roads, 3.3km of causeways, and 6 jetties installed. A massive 100 hectare nursery has been built on-site, where 25 million plants are being grown. The world’s largest battery storage system has begun construction, so that the entire project can be powered by renewable energy.

The Coral Bloom development is just one project recently announced within the Red Sea Project, with architecture inspired by the coral reef just below its shoreline. 11 unique beachside resorts, an 18 hole golf course and a yachting marina will be developed to provide a high-end, beachside resort experience along the pristine blue waters of the Red Sea. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed at the end of 2022, when the international airport and four resorts will open its doors to welcome its first visitors. The remaining 12 hotels and resorts will open in 2023. Once the entire project is complete in 2030, the entire area will play host to 50 resorts offering 8000 hotel keys and 1,300 residential properties built across 22 islands and six inland sites.

AMAALA is dubbed the ‘Riviera of the Middle East’ and is a $1 billion USD mega-project managed by the Red Sea Global. John Pagano, the CEO of The Red Sea Global is also the CEO of AMAALA. AMAALA is being developed just north of the Red Sea Project and spans an additional 13,000 km2 of land and sea focused on bringing a luxury health and wellness community to life. AMAALA plans on being completed by 2028, by which time it hopes to be a world leading luxury wellness retreat destination, with a community of artists and healers in residence.

Many have commented on how The Red Sea Development Project is a project people in the industry have waited for a lifetime to work on, primarily because of its focus on sustainability and regeneration from the beginning of development. Not only will the entire project be operated on solar and wind power, but the new roads will only play host to electric and hydrogen powered cars. The project boasts that not one iota of garbage has gone to a landfill and nothing has been washed into the sea. They claim that everything has been recycled, composted, or incinerated responsibly in environmentally-sensitive facilities where carbon is captured; the resulting ash from incineration is being used for the manufacturing of bricks.

The Red Sea Global (RSG) even partnered with the Ministry of Culture for Saudi Arabia’s first underwater archeological excavation, led by the University of Napoli L’Orientale. In November 2021, five Saudi divers from the Saudi Heritage Authority undertook an archeological mission and located a wooden shipwreck in the Red Sea. This ship is believed to date back to the 18th century and sank sometime between 1725 and 1750 in the Al Wajh lagoon. It contained hundreds of artifacts of jars, porcelain and spices as part of the ship’s cargo, which indicates the vibrancy of trading activities in the Red Sea. The calcified jugs are considered amongst the most intact and best-preserved in the Red Sea, and will remain in the seabed for divers to see. The Red Sea Global has also sponsored teams that have discovered more than 50 shipwrecks, which will be opened to tourists. The first maritime museum in the Kingdom is also being created, to exhibit underwater archeology, artifacts and various remains.

The ambition for the entire project to be powered by wind and solar energy, is in and of itself a magnificent feat – if accomplished. The development’s 50 hotels and resorts, when finished, is expected to utilize 100% renewable energy 24/7. In order to accomplish this, the project has also announced the construction of the world’s largest battery storage facility to date, which will be able to store 1000 MWh. “The size and scale of RS’s battery storage facility puts this iconic regenerative tourism destination at the forefront of the global transition towards carbon neutrality. Wind and solar capacity are expected to exceed coal and gas in less than five years, and we are keen to drive the pace of change.” Pagano said of the initiative. It is believed that the solar and wind power combination will provide region-wide energy resilience. When solar power cannot meet energy generation needs due to sand storms, wind farms will take over. The energy project expects to generate up to 650,000 MWh of 100% renewable energy whilst emitting zero CO2.

Watch Video: What Is Sustainable Development?

The project also houses three seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plants to produce clean drinking water. Another partnership with SOURCE, a company focused on delivering the first fully sustainable water brand, will provide recyclable glass bottles of drinking water to the Red Sea Project, which is produced 100% renewably, using proprietary solar powered technology that draws pure water out of the air, and converts it into premium mineralized drinking water. The SOURCE plant and bottling facility is being constructed on-site at the Red Sea Project in Saudi Arabia – and will have the capacity to produce 2 million 330ml bottles per year.

“The Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia is rich in history, positioned at the heart of global trading routes for centuries. Partnering with the Heritage and Museums Commission allows us to both explore the historical significance of this unique region and ensure the preservation of our discoveries. The Red Sea Global is committed to responsibly developing the extraordinary natural beauty and historical value of the Red Sea and we look forward to close collaboration to advance the Kingdom’s heritage conservation efforts.""

The deep fried chicken served with delicious garlic sauce has unique flavoring and spices. Their chicken nuggets are probably the second most popular item on the menu. Don’t like chicken? Have fish or shrimps instead! Bonus: Enjoy Al Baik’s vanilla ice cream with a sweet sauce of your choice!

Look out for a Balila and French Fries cart.

A traditional Hijazi delicacy, Balila consists of boiled chickpeas, vinegar, pickles (turshi), chopped cucumbers and other Arab spices like sumac. It is not rare to find a balila vendor with a crowd waiting to be served. The dish is best experienced in Ramadan, in Balad’s Qabel Street, where it is perfectly prepared due to the Hijazi tradition and served by Matouk Al Sahrif. Bonus: The jovial Matouk Al Sharif often sings the balila song in his musical voice. (Oh, Balila! They boiled you and at Qabel Street, they have crunched you!…)

Enjoy a meal of Kibda in AlBalad during Ramadan festivities.

Al Balad lights up during Ramadan festivities. Tents are set up and stalls are lined with an assortment of chocolates, dates and other traditional snacks and foods ready for purchase. Take a trip to Al Balad during this Ramadan to enjoy a plate of kibda (a spicy dish made from beef liver) served with salad and cold drinks. The sights and sounds of the busy chefs and waiters delivering hot plates of food accentuate the open air seating experience.

Enjoy scoops of Al Muhannad Ice cream.

Al Muhannad ice cream is unlike any other ice cream you’ll ever taste. It is soft, topped with powdered nuts and fruity syrup on top. The variety of flavors is the best thing about the ice cream; watermelon, strawberry, sweet melon, mango, vanilla and chocolate. The best way to have it is with all the flavours in one cup. The best part? It’s for only 4 SR. (Located in Al Safa District, near to Chennai Darbar Restaurant and Al Naseem, next to AlWan Stationary) Bonus: Get some ice cream packed for home!

Have Fool Tameez for breakfast.

This traditional Arab dish is a creamy concoction of fava beans served with thick and buttery Nan bread. It is better to be taken as breakfast early in the morning. It’s not hard to find this flavourful dish in the streets of Jeddah.

Then Mutabbakh for an evening snack.

Best enjoyed hot with a squeeze of fresh and juicy lemon or lime, this traditional Hejazi dish is stuffed pan-fried bread. It usually contains egg omelet and crunchy onions and is served cut into squares. Some varieties contain meat.

Indoor and Outdoor Fun:

Turtle Pond in Jeddah International Market.

Jeddah International Centre is probably most famous for its turtle ponds. Turtles of all ages and sizes can be observed swimming and lounging in the blue water of the pool. Above the pond, a wooden structure has been placed on which visitors can stand to look at the turtles below. Bonus: Browse the amazing antique shop near the pond!

Get a seat on Shallal’s amazing Roller Coaster

Shallal is notorious for its hair raising and thrilling rides. Shallal’s roller coaster is scary but worth the adrenaline surge. Spend a day with your friends or family at this adventurous park. Recommended rides: Sling Shot, Power Surge, Flying Carousel and Super Shot. Bonus: Enjoy food inside the park.

These are some activities, which will give you a taste of our beautiful city of Jeddah. Comment below with items that are on your Jeddah Bucket List!"

The Saudi Artists Breathing New Life into Jeddah's Oldest Neighborhood,"In Al-Balad, the historic center of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the chirping of sparrows mingles with the call to prayer from the 800-year-old minaret of the Al-Shafi'i mosque, as it has for centuries. But change is very much afoot. Workers in hard hats and high-visibility vests are busy at work on the coral stone buildings, cordoned off by aesthetically pleasing green temporary fences. A growing community of Saudi artists is moving into these narrow lanes, bringing modern energy to the UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Most of the buildings here date back between 200 and 300 years, when Al-Balad was the main entry point for Muslim travelers arriving by sea on their pilgrimage to Mecca. In recent years the district has hosted Ramadan-related events, the Red Sea International Film Festival, and the Balad Beast EDM festival. Three heritage houses, each more than 100 years old and named for the family that formerly lived in them, have been converted into small boutique hotels, the first of their kind in Al-Balad.

One of these is the Bait Jokhdar, which is accessed through an ornately carved wood door. The house has one of Al-Balad's most striking architectural features: the roshan, a traditional Arabic box balcony that's crafted from intricate wood panels called mangours and designed to let in light, provide privacy, and, in some cases, showcase the status of the building's owner. But as oil money reinvented the kingdom, those responsible for maintaining these former symbols of wealth and power moved out of Al-Balad, taking their expertise with them. However, according to Ahmad Angawi—the founder of Al-Balad's Zawiya 97, a cultural organization with a focus on art, design, and education—traditional crafts in Al-Balad are being revived, in part due to programs from the Ministry of Culture to support them.

An artist himself, Angawi established Zawiya 97 in 2019, though his connections to Al-Balad go back much further. His father, the renowned architect Sami Angawi, had an office here, and the young Ahmad spent his childhood surrounded by artisans and craftspeople. In partnership with the Ministry of Culture, he coordinates cultural programs and art spaces to encourage Jeddah's creatives to move back here.

One of the talents Zawiya 97 has championed, the fashion designer and artist Reem Abdulghani, worked as an embroidery designer for Roberto Cavalli in Florence, headed the fashion department at Riyadh's Raffles Design Institute, and launched her own namesake label. A meeting with Angawi led her to discover that the 100-year-old house in which she now works had once belonged to a branch of her father's family.

Aates, sweets, and Arabic coffee in Bait Jokhdar. Nicola Chilton “As an artist, it's important to have other artists around you,” says Saudi fashion designer and embroidery artist Reem Abdulghani (pictured above). Reem Abdulghani

Next door is Hassan Mohammed, who moved his studio into Al-Balad in December 2021. He creates vases, sculptures, and lamps from reclaimed wood—some from trees being trimmed back around the neighborhood—and gives workshops. On the wall of his studio is a poem his father composed to celebrate the beauty of Mohammed's work. “There's a lot of creative potential in Saudi Arabia, and we need more incubator spaces like these,” Mohammed says."

Wikipedia,"Entertainment megaproject in Riyadh

Qiddiya (Arabic: القِدِّية, romanized: al-qiddiyya / al-giddiyya, pronounced [ə- alɡɪdːijːa]) is a planned entertainment and tourism megaproject in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.[1] Construction started at the beginning of 2019.[1] It was planned to open in 2023,[2] though as of 2024, major projects including Six Flags Qiddiya City, the Aquarabia waterpark, and the Formula One racetrack are incomplete (with the racetrack now being scheduled to open in 2027).[3][4] It is part of the Saudi Vision 2030 program, which aims to diversify the Saudi economy.[5]

History [ edit ]

The project, which was announced in April 2017, is part of a goal to increase local spending and diversify the Saudi economy under Saudi Vision 2030.[6] The project is supported by the Public Investment Fund.[7] According to the organizers, the total number of annual visitors will by 2030 reach 17 million, and be the ""largest tourism destination worldwide"".[8][6][9] It is expected to create 325,000 jobs.[10]

The first phase of the project was planned to be completed by 2023. Upon the completion of this phase, 45 individual projects are to be completed.[11] There is a partnership agreement between Qiddiya and the University of Central Florida to train young Saudis on hospitality, tourism and sports management.[11]

Proposed activities [ edit ]

Qiddiya Speed Park [ edit ]

An FIA Grade 1 motor racing circuit, Qiddiya Speed Park, is expected to hold a Formula One or MotoGP race, currently planned for 2027.[12][13]

Construction delays to the racing circuit have caused numerous issues. The inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix was scheduled to be held at the course in December 2021, but because construction was unfinished, the event took place at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit. Because of the Formula One Group announcement in November 2020 that a Grand Prix would be held at the circuit in 2021,[14] the Saudi government allegedly paid tens of millions dollars to maintain hosting rights after completion of the project was delayed until 2027.[15][16] The announcement led to criticism against Saudi Arabia from human rights organizations for attempting to sportswash its image.

Six Flags Qiddiya [ edit ]

Six Flags Qiddiya, which is currently under construction, is planned to be the largest theme park in the Middle East at 79 acres (0.32 km2),[17] and is expected to have multiple attractions. Notable attractions will include Falcons Flight, the world's fastest, tallest, and longest roller coaster, (which will partly go over the Qiddiya circuit)[18][19] and the world's tallest drop tower ride.[20]

Dragon Ball theme park [ edit ]

In March 2024, Qiddiya, in collaboration with Toei Animation, announced the construction of the ""world's only ever Dragon Ball theme park"". It is planned to include over 30 attractions, including a ""70 meter-high Shenron"" statue that contains a roller coaster.[21] Upon the park being announced it was met with negative reception from international Dragon Ball fans who criticized Saudi Arabia's humans rights record, treatment of women, and lack of recognition of LGBT rights.[22]

What Is The Red Sea Project?

The Red Sea plan in Saudi Arabia is a brand-new tourism destination being built between the cities of Umluj and Al Wajh and along the country’s western coast. This site was picked because of its closeness to the infamous Red Sea, home to more than 90 pristine islands that have never seen people living there, and the fourth-largest barrier reef in the world.

The area around the project is home to many perplexing landscapes, such as dormant volcanoes, mountain canyons, and endless deserts interspersed with ancient cultural monuments. The project’s design also considered sustainability and the environment, drawing on various environmental research to inform the community’s objectives.

Additionally, discover the rich cultural past and plenty of historical and cultural attractions that make the Red Sea more than just a beautiful tourist destination. When its doors opened in 2023, the first guests were welcomed to enjoy everything this exceptional location offers. When the destination is finished in 2030, it will include 1,000 residential units and 8,000 rooms spread among 50 hotels.

Redefining Sustainable Development

In an era where environmental conservation and responsible tourism are increasingly crucial, the Red Sea plan in Saudi Arabia emerges as a trailblazing model of sustainable development. The master plan focuses on long-term sustainability and enhancing Saudi Arabia’s hospitality experiences. However, the strategy aims to preserve and improve marine and terrestrial habitats, infrastructure, architecture, landscape, and guest experience, setting ambitious standards for sustainable development.

At the heart of its mission lies a meticulous conservation strategy to safeguard the fragile ecosystems that call the Red Sea coastline home. The plan prioritizes limiting development to sensitive lagoon areas, protecting coral reefs, seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and nesting habitats for preserving marine and avian species.

The project protects natural ecosystems and implements innovative infrastructural solutions that reduce environmental impact and enhance resource efficiency to build a sustainable tourism destination. From potable water generation to waste management, the project’s infrastructure is designed to uphold principles of sustainability while meeting the needs of visitors and residents alike.

Red Sea Project in Saudi Arabia extends its vision beyond environmental sustainability to embrace the concept of smart cities. However, the master plan focuses on a smart infrastructure framework for telecommunications, transit, and other urban services, aiming to enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors.

An environmentalist, Layla, says, “The project sets a new standard for responsible tourism development from renewable energy initiatives to innovative waste management practices. I am inspired by their dedication to preserving the natural beauty of the Red Sea for future generations and look forward to supporting their efforts in any way I can.”

Delivering Unlimited Experiences for the Long Term

The Red Sea Project presents a unified approach to provide a limitless array of experiences at a remarkable size in one location, ensuring people will return for generations.

The plan outlines a new town, an international airport, and more than 50 new hotels for the 35,000 people living and working in the development. It also offers a roadmap for the area’s short- and long-term prosperity.

More importantly, the master plan establishes natural preserves that support the survival of delicate marine and terrestrial ecosystems while prioritizing environmental effects. Moreover, the Red Sea Project fosters a sustainable future by integrating economic growth and environmental stewardship, preserving a unique landscape for future generations.

The project propels the nation to fulfill its 2030 Vision and establishes a new benchmark for worldwide luxury travel and resort destinations.

Saudi Tourism Authority Introduces the Spectacle of the “Saudi Red Sea”

The Saudi Tourism Authority has introduced a groundbreaking initiative with the launch of the “Saudi Red Sea,” a stunning coastal destination stretching across three unique regions: North, Central, and South. This ambitious project harmoniously blends natural wonders with a rich cultural tapestry, redefining global tourism standards. With an exceptional mix of luxury, adventure, and cultural discovery, the Saudi Red Sea emerges as a transformative force in the Heart of Arabia.

Exploring the Three Distinct Regions

Northern Region: A Haven for Luxury and Marine Adventures

The northern stretch of the Saudi Red Sea is a dream destination for lovers of luxury and the sea. Iconic locations such as NEOM, Sindalah, and Amaala boast opulent resorts, exclusive yacht marinas, and state-of-the-art wellness retreats. Visitors can indulge in activities like yacht charters, snorkeling through vibrant coral ecosystems, and hiking dramatic volcanic landscapes. Golf enthusiasts will be captivated by scenic courses offering panoramic views of the azure sea.

Renowned resorts, including Nujuma (the only Ritz-Carlton Reserve in the Middle East), Shebara, St. Regis Red Sea Resort, Six Senses Southern Dunes, and Desert Rock Resort, redefine luxury hospitality with offerings such as overwater villas and curated wellness experiences. Upcoming attractions like the Amaala Yacht Club and eco-conscious luxury lodges promise an even more immersive experience for discerning travelers.

Central Region: A Fusion of Culture, Entertainment, and Adventure

At the heart of the Saudi Red Sea lies Jeddah, a vibrant metropolis brimming with cultural heritage and modern energy. From exploring the historic Al Balad district, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, to engaging in leisure activities like beach horse riding and recreational fishing, Jeddah offers something for everyone.

Jeddah also serves as the starting point for the AROYA cruise, which debuted on December 16. This luxurious three-night journey features a visit to a private Red Sea island, delivering unparalleled maritime experiences.

Southern Region: Tradition Meets Untamed Nature

The southern reaches of the Saudi Red Sea immerse travelers in Arabia’s rich traditions and pristine landscapes. Highlights include the enchanting Farasan Islands, renowned for their mangroves, abundant wildlife, and crystal-clear waters, making them a paradise for adventurers. The mist-clad Fifa Mountains, rising over 1,800 meters, offer breathtaking vistas and tranquil escapes.

Divers can explore the untouched coral reefs along the Jazan coastline, home to a vibrant underwater ecosystem. History enthusiasts will appreciate the Al Dosariyah Castle, a historic gem perched above the port of Jazan, offering a glimpse into the region’s storied past.

Effortless Access for Global Travelers

The Saudi Red Sea is more accessible than ever, thanks to a streamlined eVisa process. Eligible travelers, including holders of UK, US, and Schengen visas or residents of these regions, can easily obtain eVisas to visit this captivating destination.

Travelers can arrive via Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport, a key international gateway featuring premium lounges for First and Business Class passengers. Additionally, the eco-friendly Red Sea International Airport connects visitors to Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dubai. NEOM Bay Airport further enhances accessibility, offering flights to and from major hubs like London, Dubai, and Doha, with additional routes in development.

A Milestone in Saudi Tourism

The unveiling of the Saudi Red Sea marks another milestone in Saudi Arabia’s tourism journey. Having welcomed over 100 million visitors in 2023, Saudi Arabia achieved its 2030 tourism goals seven years ahead of schedule. The success follows the “This Land is Calling” campaign, a cinematic exploration of the kingdom’s rich culture and dynamic transformation, led by a female protagonist.

Explore the Wonders of the Saudi Red Sea

The Saudi Red Sea is now open, inviting travelers to experience a destination where luxury meets adventure and tradition intertwines with natural beauty. Whether you seek serene retreats, thrilling escapades, or a deep dive into Arabian heritage, the Saudi Red Sea promises an unparalleled journey. Be among the first to explore this extraordinary destination and embrace the wonders of the Heart of Arabia.

STA Chief Executive and Board Member, Fahd Hamidaddin, commented: “The Saudi Red Sea is redefining tourism at a time when coastal and maritime travel makes up over 50% of global tourism demand. With travelers increasingly seeking destinations that balance natural beauty with sustainability, the Saudi Red Sea offers a bold, responsible model for the future. With over 1,000 untouched islands, 500 vibrant dive sites, 1,200 fish species, 300 coral species, and 75 powder-soft beaches, visitors can explore one of the world’s most extraordinary coastlines and the longest vertical riviera in the world. As the centerpiece of Saudi’s evolving tourism landscape, this super destination has extraordinary developments offering unmatched experiences on a global scale created to preserve its ecological integrity for generations to come.“

The 5 Emerging Destinations in Saudi Arabia You Need to Know,"It wasn’t long ago that travel to Saudi Arabia was pretty much unheard of unless you were visiting on business or heading to the holy city of Makkah for the Hajj pilgrimage. The country’s extraordinary landscapes—including the Nabataean ruins of AlUla, the 1,100-mile Red Sea coast, the date palms of the Al Ahsa oasis, and the terraced mountain farms in the south—were largely unexplored by international travelers. But since the launch of e-visas in 2019, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been on a tourism fast track, aiming to welcome more than 100 million visitors a year by 2030. As part of this goal, the nation is embarking on ambitious destination-building programs, while also making its ancient heritage sites more accessible.

From historic cities and protected marine parks to futuristic urban developments springing out of the desert, here are five of the emerging destinations to know.

NEOM

NEOM is a project so futuristic that it has left many people scratching their heads and wondering if it’s actually real. (To prove the naysayers wrong, NEOM recently released a video showing that “NEOM is real”, featuring all the tangible developments to date.) It aims to stretch the realm of possibility, and that seems to be the point. There are the mind-boggling numbers associated with the Line, a new completely car-free city that will be 105 miles long, 1,640 feet high, and only 650 feet wide. The Line will have a mirrored facade, run on 100 percent renewable energy, be home to 9 million people, and have a high-speed train traveling from end-to-end in just 20 minutes.

Then there’s Trojena, the mountainous part of the NEOM project, and the Arabian Peninsula’s first winter sports destination. Opening in 2026, it will incorporate a 7,874-feet-high ski village with 18 miles of runs that will host the 2029 Asian Winter Games. Also in the works are facilities for water sports, wellness, hiking, and mountain biking. The first hotels—25hours and Morgans—are already confirmed.

But the first phase of NEOM to welcome visitors in early 2024 will be Sindalah. Centered around a luxury island and positioned as a year-round yachting hub, Sindalah aims to attract a sailing community and yacht owners from the Mediterranean and beyond who can glide through the Suez Canal and down into the Red Sea. An 86-berth marina and 75 offshore buoys will be there to welcome them, along with luxury hotels, restaurants, and retail, plus facilities for spa, wellness, golf, and sports.

The Red Sea

Spanning 10,800 square miles, Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea destination sits on the edge of the world’s fourth largest barrier coral reef and is made up of 90 islands and desert landscapes. With dormant volcanoes, mountain canyons, and historical cultural sites inland plus dive sites filled with marine life offshore, there’s much for adventurous travelers to experience. They won’t have to rough it, though. The destination will be home to 16 luxury resorts. The first three—Six Senses Southern Dunes, the St. Regis Red Sea Resort, and Nujuma, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve—are slated to open this year, and the futuristic stainless steel pod-like villas of the Sheybarah Island resort, designed by the architect of Dubai’s new Museum of the Future, are scheduled to debut in 2024. The entire Red Sea development will run on renewable energy, including all facilities, transportation, and, eventually, seaplanes.

Amaala

Lying 125 miles to the north of the Red Sea, the 1,500 square miles of Amaala are located in the Prince Mohammad bin Salman Natural Reserve. AMAALA aims to be the “world’s first integrated family wellness destination,” with a program of holistic well-being experiences, professional consultations, personalized health programs, and a year-round calendar of events. The first phases, set around the Triple Bay marina, are scheduled to open mid-2024. One big draw of the destination will be the Foster + Partners–designed Red Sea Marine Life Institute, a conservation-driven research and visitor center incorporating multidimensional experiences. What that means in real terms is that you’ll be able to snorkel with rare species, participate in lab tours, and explore the underwater world in a submarine.

Jeddah

The original maritime gateway to Makkah along the Red Sea, Jeddah has been a conduit for generations of pilgrims making the journey, many of them choosing to stay and contributing to the multicultural spirit that exists here. Today, Jeddah feels like a place that’s determined to become a destination for the future, while proudly holding onto its history and heritage.

The city’s historic center of Al-Balad is one of the most fascinating urban destinations in the country: The UNESCO World Heritage site is filled with more than 650 buildings dating back 200 to 300 years. Once the heart of the city, Al-Balad had fallen into disrepair in recent years, and the Ministry of Culture has launched a major program to rescue and restore the most at-risk buildings.

But Al-Balad is not only about history. The neighborhood has already hosted the Red Sea Film Festival and the Balad Beast electronic music festival, with a lineup of big names like Busta Rhymes, Carl Cox, and DJ Jazzy Jeff, as well as popular male and female Saudi DJs. There’s plenty more on the horizon, including new boutique hotels.

Diriyah

Located on the edge of the capital Riyadh, Diriyah and its UNESCO World Heritage site At-Turaif are of huge historical and cultural significance to the nation. Considered to be the birthplace of the kingdom, this was the the original home of the Al Saud royal family and the site of the establishment of the first Saudi state in 1727. The restored Salwa Palace, a showcase of traditional Najdi mud-brick architecture, opened in late 2022. Now it welcomes international visitors, with museums and tours led by enthusiastic young Saudi guides. Overlooking At-Turaif is the new Bujairi Terrace dining village, home to more than 20 restaurants. They include international big names like Hakkasan and Long Chim and such homegrown brands as Maiz and Takya that serve high-end Saudi cuisine.

While tourism is a key feature, Diriyah will change the face of the capital itself, eventually incorporating 38 hotels (including luxury brands Four Seasons, Oberoi, Six Senses, and Rosewood), more than 26 cultural attractions and 400 luxury and lifestyle outlets, plentiful palm groves and parks, and the kingdom’s first opera house and contemporary art museum. In addition, community centers, academies, universities, and a new metro line will serve the 100,000 inhabitants expected to make Diriyah their home in the coming years."
The Red Sea Project Saudi Arabia: An Incredible Blend Of Nature & Luxury,"The Red Sea Project is a tourism and hospitality venture developed around the most exciting natural treasures of the world in Saudi Arabia. Covering over 28,000 square kilometers of unspoiled land and pristine waters, the project embraces a vast chain of over 90 islands. It will emerge as the gold standard in regenerative tourism and sustainable development when completed. The Red Sea Project has sustainability as its central theme and places critical importance on renewable energy, water conservation, and water recycling. The project also includes mountain canyons, dormant volcanoes, heritage destinations, luxury hotels, residential ventures, entertainment resources, and leisure facilities. The Red Sea Project aims to showcase the Kingdom’s incredible potential while unlocking new cultural, social, and economic opportunities.

What is the Red Sea project?

The Red Sea Project is one of the world’s most ambitious tourism projects. It will comprise of a new sprawling complex that will be present on the shores of the Tabuk province on the west coast of Saudi Arabia. The project’s core area will be between Umluj and Al-Wajh cities and will cover 90 small islands encompassing a mammoth 28,000 square kilometers.

The first phase of the Red Sea project will complete in 2022.

The first luxury destinations developed in this phase will be opened for tourists soon.

The project aims to give a major fillip to the country’s tourism goals and will also help create 70,000 plus new jobs.

A primary goal of the project is to create a global tourism destination that respects and supports sustainability.

Project timeline

The Red Sea project was announced in 2017 by Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman and formally commenced in the same year. Construction work started in 2019. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed by 2022. The entire project is expected to be completed in 2030.

Red Sea Project location

The Red Sea project, along the Western coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, will be between Umluj and Al Wajh. The location has been carefully chosen as the area has a moderate climate throughout the year. The average summer temperature is around 31°C. A lagoon with 50 pristine and untouched natural islands stretching over 200 kilometers of the Red Sea coastline has been chosen as an exquisite luxury resort destination.

How to Reach

Tourists can take a flight, a private bus, or a car from Riyadh to Umluj. The distance is around 1200 km. Tourists can also travel to Umluj from Jeddah. It is a better and more convenient way of reaching the site. The distance is about 486 km. Additionally, tourists can also fly from Jeddah to Umluj.

The new project will also include a brand new international airport, making traveling to the destination easily. A major road infrastructure development is also part of the Red Sea project. It will involve the construction of 77 km of new roads that will connect with the airport to roads, highways, and roads within the new project. As the Red Sea project will focus on travel and tourism, the aim will be to make it as convenient and comfortable as possible for tourists to reach the destination.

Major tourist attractions

There are many goals of the Red Sea project, and all of them aim to increase the appeal of the Kingdom to the global tourists and encourage them to visit the country. The major attractions of the Red Sea project are:

1. Heritage sites

The region has footprints of numerous trading routes dating back to the Nabatean civilization. The site is uniquely positioned on the pilgrimage route when traveling from Egypt to the Holy Cities of Makkah and Madinah. Tourists can trace the routes of traders from the past and discover the remnants of history they have left behind. There are some exciting excursion potentials also available nearby. Most notable of them all is the Nabatean City of Mada’in Saleh which is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

2. Pristine and untouched islands

With the Red Sea Project, there is a concerted effort to provide visitors access to a set of unique environmental settings comprising stunning beaches, captivating canyons, majestic mountains, and eye-catching mangroves. Visitors will have a wonderful time on the pristine, sandy beaches, bright sunny weather, and sheltered warm waters. A major attraction here is the world’s fourth-largest barrier reef system. It is home to various endangered species and unseen corals. The 90-plus untouched islands are one of the project’s major highlights.

Apart from exciting eco-excursions, the islands will also offer access to many water sports activities, which will be carefully controlled and monitored.

3. An abundance of nature

The famous Hijaz Mountains form part of the Red Sea project and house a series of rare species of life. These include hawksbill turtles, wildcats, dugongs, and many others. The lagoon has a rich population of corals and fish of different species. It also has a few endangered seabirds. Prominent among them are the crab plover and the sooty falcon. The project is committed to preserving these habitats. That’s why 75 percent of the islands will not be included in the project’s development design.
