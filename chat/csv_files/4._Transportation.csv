How to Get Around in Saudi Arabia,"Buses, trains, cheap flights, and taxis – getting around Saudi Arabia is much easier than you might think.

Just a few years ago, Saudi Arabia was one of the most secluded countries in the world, and tourism was not even permitted. Well, the situation has drastically changed. Saudi Arabia now welcomes tourists and is building a tourism infrastructure larger than that of the UAE and Qatar.

I visited Saudi Arabia during its initial opening phase and now I’m planning a second trip in the coming days. I loved traveling overland in Saudi Arabia and this time, I have plans of taking buses to remote areas, a train to the holy city of Madina and even hitchhike. With everything set to go, I want to show you what I learnt and tell you how you can get around Saudi Arabia using buses, the new train system, taxis, ride-hailing apps, and car rentals.

I visited Saudi Arabia right after the country opened for tourism. First thing I did: Get a traditional outfit.

Entering Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia is investing large resources to become a main stopover destination for travelers moving between Asia and Europe. With Saudia, the largest carrier in Saudi Arabia, becoming a large competitor against Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad, the aviation landscape is evolving rapidly.

Budget airlines such as Fly Dubai and even WizzAir have also entered the market, and it’s only a matter of time before we see flights from Europe with Ryanair or EasyJet.

Riyadh, Jeddah, or Dammam are the three largest airports in the country and are likely to be your initial points of entry into Saudi Arabia. Moreover, with a straightforward e-visa process for most nationalities, Saudi Arabia is poised to attract a growing number of tourists in the coming years.

I hold a Colombian passport and usually have to apply for a visa at the embassy if I want to visit Saudi Arabia. However, some exceptions might apply to you too.

For travelers requiring an e-visa or opting for visa on arrival, here is the link to apply for an e-visa.

For visa-required visitors holding US, UK, or EU visas, here is the link to obtain an e-visa.

Tip: Book your accommodation with Agoda

Be connected at all times in Saudi Arabia.

I got a e-SIM with SIM Local and got packages depending on my internet consumption.

They offer packages from 1, 3, 5, 10 and even 20 GB.

They also have a current discount of 10% at the link here.

Riyadh became a very popular starting point for a trip in Saudi Arabia

Traveling Between Cities with National Flights

Saudi Arabia is big! Very big, and traveling long distances within the country can be time-consuming. Domestic flights offer a convenient and efficient means of transportation for intercity travel.

Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam serve as major transportation hubs, with the two local airlines, Saudia and Flynas, operating regular flights between major domestic destinations. This makes it easy to explore different regions of the country without taking lengthy road journeys.

Additionally, the strategic locations of these airports, Damman very east, Riyadh in the center of Saudi Arabia and Jeddah in the west coast, enable travelers to access a significant portion of the country by visiting these three key hubs.

Other popular destinations in Saudi Arabia, such as Madina (recently opened for tourism) and Al Ula, have also several daily flights departing from these hubs, with fares starting at 50 EUR in low season.

During my first trip to Saudi Arabia, I traveled by train from Dammam to Riyadh, flew from Riyadh to AlUla and then flew again from AlUla to Jeddah.

Witnessing Eerie Landscapes with the Saudi Arabian Train System

Traveling by train is among the most enjoyable and convenient ways to get around Saudi Arabia. The country boasts the best train infrastructure in the entire Arabian Peninsula, and with ongoing expansions, it’s only a matter of time before the entire country and neighboring nations are interconnected.

Currently, there are two operational sections of the train system, each operated by different companies.

Saudi Arabia Railways connecting the east of the country

The Haramain High-Speed Railway connecting the west of the country

Thankfully, there are numerous trains operating throughout the day, making last-minute ticket purchases hassle-free.

Trains Connecting Eastern Saudi Arabia

Saudia Arabia Railways operates two passenger train lines. One connects the capital, Riyadh, to the coastal city of Dammam (4 hours), while the other links Riyadh to Al Quorayyat near the Jordanian border (11 hours).

The Al Quorayyat – Riyadh line will take you to the closest town to the Jordan border.

For travelers on the Dammam-Riyadh line, I highly recommend a stopover in the city of Al Hofuf. Located right in the middle of the desert, Al Hofuf is a charming town that I had the pleasure of visiting during my first trip to Saudi Arabia. It’s an ideal location for an overnight stay, or if your time is limited, a short, but rewarding day trip.

A train between Dammam and Riyadh will take 4 hours

Trains Connecting Western Saudi Arabia

The Haramain High-Speed Railway connects Jeddah with the holy cities of Mecca and Madina. Bookings for this service are made through a separate website. Link Here. With one of the fastest trains globally serving these destinations, this is the optimal choice for travel within this region of Saudi Arabia.

Moreover, this train route passes through Jeddah’s International Airport, making it a convenient starting point for your Saudi Arabian journey. During my upcoming trip, I plan to take this train to visit the city of Madina, which recently opened for tourism. It’s an incredible opportunity to explore one of the holiest cities globally.

The Mecca – Jeddah – Madina train line in Saudi Arabia connects millions of pilgrims every day.

Unlike Madina, Mecca is still limited to Muslim pilgrims and even though there is not any control to “verify your religion at the entrance”, it would be a lack of respect to visit this city just for the sake of visiting Mecca. I have read in forums about travelers bragging their visits to Mecca, and I find it very disrespectful to visit a forbidden city just for saying you have been there.

Upcoming train lines in Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia is also planning to open a few more important lines in the next years. The GCC line should connect the countries of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE by train, and there is a connecting line between Jeddah and Riyadh under construction.

Keep in mind, railway tickets with Saudi Arabian Railways and with the Haramain High-Speed Railway are only a fraction of the price compared to flights (even with the budget airlines), and the trains in Saudi Arabia are brand new – making the experience of taking a train in Saudi Arabia a total treat. This is my favorite way to travel in Saudi Arabia, and I can’t wait for the upcoming lines (especially the GCC line) to open.

The GCC line will become one of the most important transport train connections in Asia

International and national buses

Even though Saudi Arabia’s neighboring countries are not yet connected with high-speed trains or budget flights, buses are quite reliable for those who want to combine Saudi Arabia with Bahrain or the UAE.

International buses in Saudi Arabia

For international travel, SAPTCO is the only company that offers bus connections between Saudi Arabia and these countries. Tickets are quite affordable, and all departures start from the city of Dammam.

A trip from Dammam to Dubai takes around 13 hours, or a trip from Dammam to Bahrain takes only 2.5 hours. Unfortunately, there are only one or two connections every day, and booking a ticket at least a few days in advance is recommended.

I visited Bahrain using the SAPTCO bus connecting Dammam and Bahrain. I booked everything online

What about buses between Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar?

Unfortunately, there are no buses connecting these destinations. Travelers wanting to visit Qatar from Saudi Arabia have to travel with a private transfer or take a flight. In Qatar, non-GCC travelers also have issues entering the country with their own cars, so don’t try it.

For Kuwait is exactly the same. The easiest option is to get to the border town and from there arrange a private vehicle to cross you. I did this to get from Dammam to Bahrain and it worked very well. It was very expensive though.

And yes, you can get VOA (visa on arrival) at any of the land borders in Saudi Arabia (if your nationality applies for it).

NOTE: SAPTCO also manages most municipal buses in Saudi Arabia, but for the intermunicipal buses, SAPTCO is rebranded as Satrans for national intercity buses.

Getting a Saudi visa is everyday easier. It’s just a matter of time until the country becomes visa free for everyone.

National buses in Saudi Arabia

For those wanting to travel between Saudi Arabia by bus, there are two companies available on the market:

This is the most affordable way of traveling around Saudi Arabia, but also the least efficient and slowest. Buses from Riyadh to Jeddah with Satrans take around 12 hours and cost around 50 EUR one way. This is not worth the price, taking into consideration that a flight might cost only 20 EUR more and take only 1 hour.

While Satrans also connects Jeddah with Riyadh, most bus stations from Satrans are located in the south of the country.

Here is a map of all Satrans stations located in Saudi Arabia.

For travelers going north, Northwest Bus is their best option. Here, you can find bus connections to Madina and even to AlUla.

With local buses you can easily get to AlUla. Saudi Arabia’s big highlight.

Car rentals for total freedom

Car rentals in Saudi Arabia are also quite popular. This is the most convenient option for planning day trips around key cities and moving short and remote distances. Major cities like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam have standard car rental companies offering a wide range of vehicles to suit every budget. Additionally, Saudi Arabia’s well-maintained highways and roads are relatively straightforward, making self-driving a popular choice.

Most (if not all) travelers in AlUla rent a car to move around more freely, and more experienced travelers can get a vehicle in Madina and travel from this holy city to AlUla on a road trip.

Unlike Oman, where a 4WD vehicle improves the travel experience a lot, you can get in Saudi Arabia a small car for 40-50 EUR per day and make the most of the country.

The only way to visit this place in AlUla is by renting a car and traveling there.

Taxis and Ride-Hailing Services (Uber, Careem, and Co.)

Yes, Uber works in Saudi Arabia. This is one of the most convenient apps to move around large cities. Rides may be a bit more expensive than conventional taxis with a taximeter, but the convenience of Uber is simply flawless. Careem is another company that works very well in the Middle East. A ride with Careem may be a bit cheaper than Uber, but this is not always the case – there is for sure more availability.

Taxis in Saudi Arabia also work very well. Unlike countries like Egypt and Jordan, in which you have to negotiate with the driver, in Jeddah or Riyadh, you can simply hail a cab, and the driver will automatically use the taximeter. This is one of the most convenient ways to travel around Saudi Arabia’s cities.

Due to the long distances and non-optimal public transport in Riyadh, Uber was my app to go.

What about hitchhiking in Saudi Arabia?

I have met several travelers who hitchhiked in Saudi Arabia and found it a great adventurous option. Based on my research on travel forums, this was an option for travelers trying to get to Qatar from Saudi Arabia for the World Cup. Other travelers have covered remote parts of Saudi Arabia hitchhiking and have not found any trouble. Saudi Arabia is probably one of the safest countries in the world (for men and women), and you will only encounter friendly people trying their best to help. The only risk is that you gain weight from all the invitations to have dinner with a random family.

NOTE: Crossing borders on foot in Saudi Arabia is forbidden. If you try this, you will be sent back at the first checkpoint.

Despite the description of the country in some news media, I felt in Saudi Arabia extremely welcomed. Everyone spoke very good english and I was able to talk to everyone about everything.

Communication in Saudi Arabia

When it comes to direct communication with locals, Saudi Arabia has a very high index of education. Most people I encountered on my trip spoke perfect English, and those who didn’t were extremely friendly and helpful in whatever I needed.

Additionally, having a connection to the internet at all times was super practical for translating or asking where to go.

For those concern about paper tickets and communication at bus and metro stations, all bookings for busses and trains are possible to do online, and online tickets are the standard in the country.

Madina opened for tourism and maybe Mecca might open too in the upcoming years.

When it comes to internet connection on the road, during my first visit in Saudi Arabia, I got a SIM card from Virgin with 20GB for 20 EUR (more or less). This is still the cheapest option for travelers needing high data.

For my second trip, I will use my global plan of Flexiroam and maybe get a local SIM card with Virgin once I settle down in Jeddah.

The most convenient option is to get a country plan with Airalo a few days before traveling. A 10 GB plan costs 25 EUR, but you will get internet right after you land in Saudi Arabia."
Getting to and Around Saudi Arabia: Transportation Guide,"Getting Around Saudi Arabia

With its vast and diverse landscape, a Saudi Arabia holiday is best enjoyed with multiple stops. The country boasts an impressive infrastructure that makes domestic travel both easy and convenient.

The country’s high-speed train, known as the Haramain Train, is another great option for fast, efficient and comfortable travel. The train currently links major towns including Jeddah, Mecca and Medina. (Note: non-Muslims cannot enter Mecca thus not use the train between Jeddah and Mecca)."

Utilizing self-service machines

Taxis

They follow a metered system, so it is recommended to ensure that the meter is running throughout your journey. The starting fare for taxis in Riyadh is SAR 5 (in most places), with an additional charge of SAR 2 per kilometer traveled.

Ride-Sharing Applications

Ride-sharing applications such as Uber and Careem are widely used in Riyadh. These apps offer a convenient way to book rides at affordable rates, making them an attractive alternative to traditional taxi services.

Riding the Rails: Metro and the Haramain Railway

The Riyadh Metro, currently under construction, promises to bring a new, quick, and green mode of transport to the city. It’s comprised of 6 lines and will serve areas like King Khalid International Airport and King Abdullah Financial District.

The same goes for Jeddah, with the anticipated Jeddah Metro, which will facilitate transport around the city and to the airport.

And then there’s the renowned Haramain High-Speed Railway, a state-of-the-art rail network directly connecting the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah. Hajj and Umrah pilgrims often take advantage of this modern marvel, appreciating the comfort and speed it offers.

The Haramain High-Speed Railway connects Makkah to Madinah via Jeddah and King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC). This provides a convenient and efficient transportation option, particularly for travelers coming from Makkah. The cost of a single journey ticket between Jeddah and Madinah ranges from SAR 20 to SAR 75 and takes about 30 – 35 mins to reach.

How to book the Haramain Railway ticket?

You can visit either through their official website or their dedicated counters at the train station. The cost of a single journey ticket between Makkah to Madinah ranges from SAR 85 to SAR 90 and takes about 2.5 hrs to reach.

Both the metro and Haramain services represent the future of public transportation in Saudi Arabia, and they are testaments to the country’s commitment to offering efficient, and sustainable options for travel.

Sailing the Arabian Waters: Sea Transport in Saudi Arabia

While Saudi Arabia’s potential for sea transport is immense, owing to its extensive Red Sea and Arabian Gulf coastlines, it’s important to note that the commercial sea routes are still in their developmental phase. However, a few ferry routes do operate.

How to Get to AlUla: Travel Tips and Routes,"AlUla, located in northwestern Saudi Arabia, is a stunning destination known for its rich history, magnificent landscapes, and cultural heritage. As more people discover this gem, travel options to AlUla have become increasingly accessible. Whether you’re traveling by air or planning a road trip, this guide will provide you with the essential travel tips and routes for getting to AlUla.

By Air: Flying to AlUla

Domestic and International Flights

The most convenient way to get to AlUla is by air, thanks to Prince Abdul Majeed bin Abdulaziz Domestic Airport (IATA: ULH), which is located approximately 35 kilometers southeast of the city center. The airport is small but modern, with facilities catering to both domestic and select international travelers.

Domestic Flights:

There are regular flights to AlUla from major Saudi Arabian cities, making it easy to reach from different parts of the country. If you’re flying from Riyadh, Jeddah, or Dammam, you can find direct flights to AlUla. The flight from Riyadh typically takes around 1 hour and 45 minutes, while flights from Jeddah take around 1 hour and 20 minutes.

International Flights:

AlUla is opening up to more international routes, particularly from the Gulf region and other key destinations. For example, international flights from Dubai and other Middle Eastern cities are beginning to be offered seasonally or for special events in AlUla. It’s advisable to check with airlines for the latest schedules, as routes are continuously expanding to accommodate growing demand.

Airlines Operating to AlUla:

Saudia, Flynas, and other regional airlines operate flights to AlUla. Depending on the season and demand, flights may vary, so it’s recommended to book in advance, especially during peak tourist seasons like winter when AlUla’s weather is perfect for outdoor activities and festivals.

By Road: Driving to AlUla

Road Routes from Major Cities

For those who prefer the adventure of a road trip, driving to AlUla offers scenic views and the freedom to explore at your own pace. AlUla is well-connected by roads to several major cities in Saudi Arabia.

From Riyadh:

The distance between Riyadh and AlUla is approximately 1,000 kilometers. The drive typically takes around 10 to 12 hours, depending on traffic and stops. The route takes you through the vast desert landscapes, offering an authentic Arabian road trip experience. It’s essential to plan for fuel stops and breaks along the way, as some stretches of the road are quite remote.

From Jeddah:

The distance between Jeddah and AlUla is around 700 kilometers, with an average drive time of 7 to 8 hours. This route takes you through the western part of Saudi Arabia, with opportunities to stop in cities like Yanbu on the Red Sea coast, providing a scenic coastal detour if time allows.

From Medina:

If you are starting from Medina, AlUla is just a 4-hour drive away (around 330 kilometers). This route is popular for those looking to combine a visit to the holy city of Medina with an exploration of AlUla’s historical sites. The drive is relatively straightforward, with good road conditions for most of the journey.

Renting a Car

Renting a car is a popular option for travelers wishing to explore AlUla and the surrounding areas independently. Car rental services are available in major cities such as Riyadh, Jeddah, and Medina, as well as at the Prince Abdul Majeed bin Abdulaziz Domestic Airport in AlUla. Roads in the region are generally well-maintained, but it’s recommended to rent a sturdy vehicle, especially if you plan to venture off the beaten path and explore AlUla’s more remote attractions.

By Bus: Public Transportation to AlUla

Public bus services to AlUla are available, though less common than air and car travel. SAPTCO (Saudi Public Transport Company) operates bus services between AlUla and other major cities in Saudi Arabia, such as Riyadh, Jeddah, and Medina. The bus routes tend to take longer than driving or flying but can be a cost-effective option for budget-conscious travelers. The buses are generally comfortable and air-conditioned, with rest stops along the way.

For example, the bus journey from Riyadh to AlUla can take up to 16 hours, while the trip from Jeddah might take around 12 hours. It’s advisable to check the SAPTCO website for the most up-to-date schedules and fares before planning your trip.

Travel Tips for Visiting AlUla

Best Time to Visit

The best time to visit AlUla is during the cooler months, between October and March. During this period, the weather is pleasant, making it ideal for outdoor activities such as hiking, exploring archaeological sites, and attending cultural festivals like Winter at Tantora. Summer months (June to September) can be extremely hot, with temperatures soaring above 40°C (104°F), making outdoor exploration less comfortable.

Packing Essentials

If you’re planning to explore AlUla’s outdoor attractions, be sure to pack appropriate clothing and gear. Lightweight, breathable clothing is essential for daytime, while warmer layers are recommended for evenings, especially during the winter months when desert temperatures can drop significantly. Comfortable walking shoes are a must for exploring rocky terrain, and don’t forget sun protection such as hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen.

Local Transportation in AlUla

Once you arrive in AlUla, getting around is relatively easy. Car rentals are the most flexible option, allowing you to explore at your own pace. Taxis and ride-hailing services like Careem are also available for getting around the town and to nearby sites. Some tour operators offer guided tours with transportation included, which can be a convenient way to visit popular attractions like Hegra, Elephant Rock, and Dadan.

Getting to AlUla has become increasingly accessible, whether you choose to fly, drive, or take a bus. With a range of options to suit different travel preferences, visiting this extraordinary destination is easier than ever. From the ancient tombs of Hegra to the breathtaking desert landscapes, AlUla promises an unforgettable experience for all who make the journey.

Cities I visited

My original plan was to visit Riyadh, Jeddah and AlUla. But once I started looking at transportation options (or lack thereof), I realized that I would need to include a 4th city – Madinah (Medina). From what I read, taking the bus (or a combination of train and bus) between AlUla and Jeddah seemed to be the most popular option, but there was no way to travel directly by public transport between the 2 cities without stopping in Madinah. So I added the holy city to my itinerary—but not before double checking that, as a non-Muslim, I was even allowed to visit the city. There was conflicting info online, but I can confirm that it is possible to visit Madinah. Apparently, in 2021, the Muslims-only rule was relaxed, although—officially, I think (more on this in the next post)—non-Muslims are still prohibited from entering the gates of the Masjid al-Nabawi (Prophet’s Mosque) compound in the centre of the city (FYI, Islam’s holiest city, Mecca/Makkah, remains strictly for Muslims only).

I arrived in Riyadh from London in December 2023, stayed a night, and then early the next morning, I flew to AlUla in the northwestern part of the country. From there, I made my way south to Madinah and continued on to Jeddah on the Red Sea coast. I then left for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for a couple of weeks, before returning to Riyadh in January 2024.

Inter-City Travel

First off, Saudi Arabia is not a cheap travel destination. It’s considered a high-income country, so prices in general are on par with what you’d find in developed countries (fuel being an exception!). However, since Saudi Arabia has really only just started opening up to non-religious tourists in recent years, the tourism industry and transport infrastructure aren’t well developed. It’s also a big country, and getting around means having to travel great distances. But don’t expect the same number of choices or frequency of trains and buses between major cities as you would find in more tourist-friendly destinations. There is no country-wide rail network.

Al Olaya, the central business district in Riyadh

The most convenient way to get across the country is by flying, although it can be pricey if you have a tight schedule and not a lot of flexibility. I paid C$308 (US$227) for a one-way, less-than-2-hour flight (purchased almost 2 months in advance) on Saudia from Riyadh to AlUla! Of course, if you can find a flight on Flynas—the low-cost carrier—you’ll get better fares.

There are direct flights between AlUla and Jeddah, but unless you get a flight time that fits your schedule, flying can mean crisscrossing the country, from AlUla in the northwest via Riyadh in the centre and back towards Jeddah on the west coast.

Self-driving between cities is another option, and one that I did consider, as it’s really the most convenient way to get around, not to mention a great way to see the country! Gas prices are cheap too (C$0.78 / US$0.58 per litre when I was there). However, driving solo for 10 to 12 hours from Riyadh to AlUla, and approximately 8 hours from AlUla to Jeddah—with limited time—seemed a little too daunting, even for an adventurous spirit like me.

Drivers beware! There are no fences or guard rails at the Edge of the World

If you’re trying to get between AlUla and Madinah, your only budget option is travelling by bus. There are no trains. While booking domestic flights is pretty straightforward, trying to book a bus proved a herculean task! When I started my research in September 2023, there was one bus company, Saudi Public Transport Company (SAPTCO) that served the whole country. Every blog post about Saudi Arabia that I read mentioned that I should book my tickets on the SAPTCO website, and that there was only 1 bus a day going in each direction (AlUla to Madinah at 8am; Madinah to AlUla at 5:30pm), so I planned my itinerary accordingly. Then 3 weeks before arriving in the country, I discovered that I could no longer book the bus tickets on the website because the destinations weren’t listed anymore. After some digging, I found my answer on a TripAdvisor forum, where a contributor had posted just a few weeks prior, that SAPTCO was no longer servicing the whole country, but rather, there were now 3 bus companies, each servicing a different region. For the northwestern region (which includes AlUla and Madinah), tickets would now have to be booked through NorthWest Bus.

But I soon realized it was impossible to even use the NorthWest Bus website! Even if you selected English for the language, the page still opened up in Arabic. You could choose to translate to English, but it didn’t make much difference, as you can see in these screenshots from November 2023:

If you clicked on the dropdown menu, it quite literally translated the names of the cities—or at least, that was what I thought. But which city would be called something that means “to the devil”?!🤣

A few days later, I tried the website again—this time using my phone instead of my laptop—and the website worked! The one-way bus ticket from AlUla to Madinah (journey of 5 hours and 18 minutes) was SAR 109 (C$39 / US$29) but by then, I’d already decided I’d just buy the ticket in AlUla. Once there though, I changed my mind about taking the bus and splurged SAR 600 (C$215 / US$160) to go the 340 km to Madinah by private taxi, which my hotel kindly arranged for me.

I had originally planned to take the Haramain High Speed train from Madinah to Jeddah. They have many trains a day, and from everything I’d read, it seemed like a pretty comfortable and relaxing way to travel. However, when I was in Madinah and trying to book the train, I found out that each passenger is only allowed 1 piece of luggage (55cm x 65cm x 35cm, with a maximum weight of 25 kg), and 1 handbag. If your bag is oversized or too heavy, they will send it, for an additional fee, via Saudi post. I wasn’t sure how strictly this rule was enforced, but I didn’t want to take a chance with my luggage. Fortunately, I was able to find a last minute flight to Jeddah on Flynas for SAR 293 (C$105 / US$78), which was within the range of prices for business class tickets on the high speed train, so it seemed like a pretty good deal, all things considered.

Intra-City Travel

City buses are the only public transport available in Jeddah and Riyadh. I never took the buses, so I don’t know how efficiently they run or how easy it is to get around if you don’t speak or read Arabic. I did walk by the nicest bus stop I’d ever seen though. I’m guessing they’re not all like this, but the one I saw was enclosed, with air conditioning, complete with an ATM machine inside!

Most travellers find it easiest to get around the main cities by taxi or ride-sharing. The latter is probably a bit more expensive, but generally more convenient. There are a number of ride-sharing apps in Saudi Arabia, but the 2 most popular ones are Careem and Uber. I had read that Careem might sometimes be a little cheaper, but I had issues installing the app so I just ended up using Uber in Madinah, Jeddah and Riyadh . The costs certainly add up when you’re solely relying on ride-sharing or taxis, but until they get the Metro system up and running (the Riyadh Metro hadn’t yet been completed when I was there and is supposed to begin operation in December 2024, and the Jeddah Metro is apparently under construction too) or you want to figure out the local bus routes, you don’t really have any other choice.

Construction on the Riyadh Metro in January 2024

A couple times, simply out of convenience, I did take what I guess are unlicenced taxis (I didn’t really think about it as such at the time). I ensured that they didn’t charge me more than the rate on Uber, and also confirmed beforehand that they accept credit card. However, when it came time for payment, they would say they couldn’t take my credit card, and asked for cash. What did they do when I insisted I didn’t have any cash on hand? They would drive to a gas station, fill up to the cost of my ride, and then I would pay for it!

I had imagined spending hours exploring the cities on foot, just as I’d done in other countries, but quickly realized that Saudi cities are really spread out and not pedestrian-friendly! Every time I googled the directions to walk from one place to another, it always seemed to take an impossibly long time. Sometimes, even if you just want to walk to a place across the street, it can mean having to take a 15-minute circuitous route because there’s no crosswalk or footbridge in sight.

Driving and Car Rental

You could, of course, opt to drive. Depending on the length of your trip and the number of places you want to visit, it might actually be the cheapest option. I reached out to a female travel blogger to learn more about her experience renting a car in Riyadh on her own. She had driven in the Philippines before, and said that in comparison, driving in Saudi Arabia was pretty easy, especially outside of the big cities. She also recommended bringing a phone holder, since she had gotten fined for having her phone in her hand while trying to navigate using GPS. Although online sources suggest getting an International Driving Permit, she managed to get by with a Belgian driver’s licence even though it was in Dutch!

I didn’t end up driving in Jeddah and Riyadh, but I decided that I was going to have to rent a car in AlUla. Considering that I had just seen some sobering statistics on road traffic fatality rates in Saudi Arabia, I was a little hesitant, to say the least! But in AlUla, there just aren’t a lot of options, unless you go there as part of a tour group. AlUla actually encompasses an area with a number of archaeological sites spread throughout. I would regularly drive 20 to 30 minutes to get from one place to another. It’s no wonder all the independent travellers who’ve been to AlUla recommend self-driving. There’s no way I could’ve seen everything if I hadn’t driven. You could rely on Careem and Uber drivers, but I’d read that you could be waiting up to 30 minutes for your ride to arrive, which would be highly inconvenient especially since you have to pre-book certain times to access the various sites. You could probably try arranging for a private driver, but it most certainly would be very expensive!

Driving around AlUla

Before flying in, I found out which car rental companies had a presence at the AlUla airport and tried to pre-book a car. It was an incredibly frustrating experience! I initially tried to book with Lumi, and when that didn’t work out, I tried Budget, but their website wouldn’t accept my credit card. My bank confirmed there were no issues with my card, so I emailed Budget in Saudi Arabia. The person who replied said he would pass my email on to someone else, but eventually nothing came of it. So, without a confirmed booking, I wasn’t even sure I’d get the car I wanted when I got to the Budget counter at AlUla airport. Thankfully, it all worked out in the end, and I picked up the car (I got an International Driving Permit prior to arriving in the country). Unlike renting a car in Canada or the U.S., where it’s the norm to get unlimited mileage included in the price, car rentals in Saudi Arabia typically include a limit of 300 km/day, with the option to purchase more. Including additional mileage and insurance, my car rental cost SAR 182.70/day (C$65 / US$48.50). They also advised me that they would charge a SAR 2000 (C$715 / US$533) deposit, which would be refunded after I return the car. This is standard practice to offset any traffic fines you might incur while driving the rental car. In my case, Budget just put a pre-authorized hold on the deposit amount, but didn’t actually charge me.

My car rental in AlUla

Saudi drivers are notorious for being reckless and ignoring speed limits and traffic rules. It’s not surprising the first thing I saw when I got onto the highway from the airport was a car accident! I noticed that when drivers were overtaking, they often cut back into the lane dangerously closely, leaving minimal distance between their car and mine. One time, I was just pulling out onto a main road, and I saw a car coming head on towards me! For a split second I thought I had wrongly turned onto a one-way street! But then I realized the oncoming car was actually overtaking another car (or maybe a few cars!), and managed to make it back into its lane just in the nick of time! That was the scariest moment for me.

The highway from the airport towards AlUla Old Town

However, despite my experiences, I would have no qualms driving again in Saudi Arabia! I drive in Malaysia, and although driving there isn’t as crazy as other Southeast Asian countries, I found it less stressful driving in Saudi Arabia, where there are no narrow roads with traffic congestion, or motorcyclists riding in blind spots or perilously weaving in and out of traffic. There are lots of wide open roads that are well-maintained, excellent highways—not unlike what you’d find in Canada and the U.S.—and driving in a town centre is actually pretty civil compared to some other countries. Road signs are generally in both Arabic and English, although numbers—on speed limit signs, for example—are in Arabic only. But it shouldn’t be a problem unless you’re driving faster than the locals! And anyway, with all the speed bumps—there are lots of them, and they’re not always clearly indicated—it’s best to slow down. Let’s just say, my car was subjected to more wear and tear than it should have been, had I been more attentive to unmarked speed bumps (one of the screws on my front licence plate was actually jolted loose and fell off somewhere, and I had to ask Nadim, the friendly Bangladeshi receptionist at my hotel, to find and drill in a replacement screw)!

Entering, Leaving, and Getting a SIM Card

Due to the cold weather in Canada and London, my hands were so dry and cracked that I had trouble producing a digital thumbprint at Saudi Immigration. The officer kept asking me to clean my fingertips with the antibacterial gel provided, even as I tried to explain that my fingers weren’t dirty! I had to scan both my thumb and index finger several times before one finally registered. It was a slight hiccup that I didn’t think any more of once I exited to the Arrivals hall. I was just thrilled to see that, at almost midnight, the STC shop was still open and I could buy a SIM card right away (an STC SIM is most recommended, as it offers the best country-wide coverage). I expected a quick, no-fuss transaction. Little did I know things were about to get a lot more complicated: fingerprint biometrics isn’t just used at Immigration – it’s even required to buy a SIM card!

After six unsuccessful attempts trying to get my fingerprint, the STC salesperson informed me that he had to pass the task on to his co-worker. And after another six tries, I was locked out of their system. I was in disbelief! I pleaded with them but the only solution they could offer was for me to try another STC shop in a different terminal.

When I had initially exited to the Arrivals area, I was approached by several taxi drivers, each offering to take me to my hotel. I declined all of them, but one driver was very persistent, and insisted on waiting for me to get my SIM card. He turned out to be a lifesaver because when I needed to find that second STC shop, he offered to drive me to the other terminal!

At the second terminal, I found myself in yet another long queue. After waiting what seemed like forever, I failed again to produce a viable fingerprint—both at the STC shop and another mobile phone provider next door. By then, it was probably close to 2 am, and I was completely exhausted and utterly frustrated. I was counting on having internet access on the go to use Google Maps, research places of interest, book tickets, etc. Moreover, how was I going to drive in AlUla without GPS navigation?!

Eventually, I got back to my hotel near the airport. Prior to the debacle, I’d negotiated and settled on a price for the ride, but I ended up paying the driver a premium in appreciation for his assistance. In desperation, I asked both him and the hotel receptionist if they could somehow help me get a SIM card (never mind that it was around 3 am at that point)!

Oasis Heritage Trail in AlUla

The next morning, I flew to AlUla, and after sorting out my car rental, I went to the tourism info desk to pick up a paper map. They didn’t have any and—thinking that it hadn’t occurred to me to find a map online—the lady suggested that I could use my phone. So, I launched into my SIM card saga as she listened sympathetically. She recounted my experience to the seller at the STC booth and then did something I would’ve never expected. She asked if she could give her own fingerprint in place of mine! When that was, unfortunately, not possible, she kindly offered to purchase a SIM card in her name for me!

Alas, I didn’t have to take up her offer because when I attempted one last time, I managed to provide a fingerprint that was passable enough for the vendor. Honestly, I think he accepted it more out of compassion than clarity!

Sunset at Al Diwan, AlUla

I was relieved to finally have a SIM card, and also incredibly grateful to the lady. I couldn’t thank her enough for the lengths she was willing to go to to assist me! I filled out a feedback card with nothing but praise for her. It was the very least I could do for someone who went above and beyond to help a total stranger. This unexpected challenge turned into a wonderful reminder of the hospitality and kindness I encountered throughout my journey.

I should add that my problems with fingerprint biometrics didn’t end there! A digital fingerprint is required even when exiting the country! After several failed thumbprint attempts at Immigration at Jeddah airport, I was asked to go to an office. I think my first thought was that I was going to be detained or something and I’d miss my flight! Seeing a roomful of serious-looking uniformed male officials only heightened my anxiety. But this gave way to relief when the one of them took my passport and, with a warm laugh, said “Don’t worry. If you have any problems, just come and see me—I will take care of everything.” With that, he stamped my passport, and I was good to go!

Flying over the Saudi Arabian desert

Spending a few weeks in the tropical heat of Malaysia did wonders for the skin on my hands, and when I returned for the second time to Saudi Arabia, things went a lot smoother at Immigration!

Next up – the final installment of my Saudi Arabia series. In case you missed it, make sure to read my previous post on Saudi Arabia: Trip Planning."
2 Weeks in Saudi Arabia Itinerary,"As soon as you arrive at the airport, make sure to purchase an STC local SIM card at the arrival hall, preferably the 30-day one, so that you can use it for navigation throughout your trip. Then, withdraw some cash for emergencies.

Having around 1,200 SAR should suffice in case some places do not accept credit cards. Out of all the gas stations we visited across the country, only one didn't accept credit cards, so it's always handy to have some cash on hand.

After all is done, it's time to drive on the infamous Saudi roads. Get yourself acquainted with the rules of the jungle, I mean road here, and don't go faster than 80 km/hr when not on a highway. Retreat to your hotel, rest up, and prepare for an adventure the next day.

On your second day, you can start your day by visiting Masmak Fortress, a unique-looking fortress with a rich history to tell. You can park at the paid parking lot in front of the fortress. It should cost around 5 SAR per hour and it should take you no more than that to see the fortress.

Next up, we are going to visit the National Museum, a massive museum with several sections dedicated to each period of Saudi Arabia from prehistoric times to the age of oil and modernization. A perfect place to learn more about the history of Saudi Arabia.

The museum is massive, so be sure to allocate at least an hour or 2 here. There is no entrance fee to enter, which I think was pretty awesome of them. There are plenty of free parking spots in front of the museum, so you should have no trouble getting here.

Don't forget to drop by Murabba Historical Palace, a beautifully renovated former palace, home to a museum with a great collection of artifacts, traditional attire, and decorative art. It's connected to the national museum, so you should be able to walk there.

This was a photo I took at Boulevard World, next to Boulevard City. I didn't have any clear photos of Boulevard City as I was stuck in traffic much of the time. In the evening, you can hang out at Boulevard City and see what the future holds for the capital city of Saudi Arabia, with its stunning light shows, bright billboards reminiscent of Times Square, and plenty of restaurants and cafes to enjoy. You can park for free at this parking lot. On the second day, you can start a little later and visit Kingdom Center Sky Bridge for an incredible view of the city. The viewpoint is located on the 77th floor, so you will be able to see all the hyper-modern skyscrapers in Riyadh, including the iconic Al Faisaliah Tower. The ticket is 69 SAR per person, and you can buy it once you are there.

You can then explore the shopping mall there or at Al Faisaliah Tower, another iconic tower in Riyadh, with its iconic golden globe at the top. There's a mall inside as well as an alternative observation deck you can check out.

In the evening, you can go and explore Al Bujairi Heritage Park, a massive park situated in the historic district of Diriyah, the oldest part of the city, as well as the place where the founding father of Saudi Arabia, the House of Saud, resided.

The park is filled with restaurants, cafes, and recreational facilities for you to enjoy. It's important to note that the park is only open from 5 PM to 4 AM, so make sure you plan your visit accordingly and arrive after 5 PM.

The entrance fee is about 50 SAR, and you have to buy the ticket online here before you can enter. There is a paid parking lot available near Heritage Park. Alternatively, you could also park along this road for free, as I did. It is not much further than the paid parking lot.

Within Al Bujairi Heritage Park, you will find At-Turaif World Heritage Site, which is the actual birthplace of the first Saudi state and the ancestral home of the Saudi royal family, the Al Sauds.

The place is huge, and you can expect to spend at least an hour or two just exploring At-Turaif alone. It is a maze of winding and crisscrossing streets and alleyways, so be sure to spend some time and explore thoroughly.

Be sure to stay here until sunset, so you can witness its incredible light and sound show, which tells the history of Saudi Arabia from its founding days to its struggles with powers to the modern Saudi Arabia state we see today.

After you're done exploring Al Bujairi Heritage Park, make sure to visit Almesainad District, an upcoming trendy spot where you'll find many locals hanging out at night. We stumbled upon it by accident while looking for a more affordable place to have dinner near Al Bujairi.

On your third day in Riyadh, you can spend the rest of the morning relaxing at your hotel as we will be going on a tour to the Edge of the World, definitely the highlight of visiting Riyadh.

It is located approximately 98 km north of Riyadh and it requires 4WD and a guide to navigate the desert to get there, so you will have to go on an organized tour instead. The tour will pick you up from this meeting point in Riyadh around 2 PM and it should take about 6 hours in total.

You should arrive around 4 PM, and you will have about 2-3 hours to freely roam the canyon. You can hike all the way down to the massive rock outcrop and hang your feet off the Edge of the World, just be very mindful of your step as the cliff is very high above the ground.

Just before the tour ends, the guide will direct you to a small plateau where you can get a clear view of the iconic rock outcrop during sunset as it is surrounded by the dramatic landscape of the Edge of the World. It is quite a sight to behold and makes the bumpy journey worthwhile.

Be sure to book the tour beforehand, preferably a few days earlier, as it can get booked out quite fast during the peak season. The tour also provides a basic dinner in the desert experience before they drop you off in Riyadh around 8 PM. Rest up for the night as we have a long drive ahead of us.

While the Heritage Market might not be as active during the day, it's still worth visiting for its beautiful architecture. You can also explore the local museum here for free, as well as a nearby mosque, which features a towering minaret.

Right behind the mosque, you will find a narrow trail, leading you into the ruins of the old mud houses here. You can explore the old ruins, climb up to one of the mud houses, and enjoy the view from above. The walkways are well-maintained and go in and out of these mud houses, which is extremely fun to explore.

After you are done, you can also check out the new old market they are renovating right by the old mud houses and take some photos. Although it is artificial, it is still quite nice to see and imagine what it must have been like in its heyday.

Next up, we visit another mud village called Ushaiqer Heritage Village, located about 15 minutes' drive from Hlewa Heritage Market. This village is definitely more well-lived-in, with a small community still living inside the mud houses.

There are many more crisscrossing streets here with many hidden gems like Ushaiqer Heritage Mosque, Al Salem Museum, and more, so be sure to spend an hour exploring the area thoroughly.

I quite like the contrast of the striking shadows and the mud houses' brownish exterior. It can result in some really stunning photos, so get your camera ready. Both of the heritage villages (Hlewa and Ushaiqer) are free of charge, which I think is pretty awesome.

Once you are done here, you can continue for about 2 hours until you arrive in Unayzah, stop for a late lunch, before heading over to Albassam Heritage House to learn more about the history of this part of Saudi Arabia.

Albassam Heritage House is an old heritage house owned by a local family that dates all the way back to the 14th Century. Now, it is converted into a cultural center where you will be guided through each room, with small exhibitions about traditional attire, traditional tools to make food, and how to store their dates for months without them going bad.

You will learn about each room and its functions, and at the end of the tour, you will enjoy a lovely welcome Arabic coffee and dates, with a cool presentation of how they entertain people while making coffee. The coffee maker would create rhythmic sounds from his coffee grinder as he sings along to its tune. It was pretty awesome!

And all that is for free! How awesome is this? We went to 3 places and all of them are free. I'm sure this won't last as tourists pick up in the country, so enjoy it while it lasts!

After you are done, be sure to check out Al Musawkaf Market behind it. Although they are not open until 4 PM, you should be able to enter, walk around, and take some photos.

It is pretty cool with palm trees in the middle of a large courtyard surrounded by all kinds of local shops. Spend some time here and walk around before we continue driving to Hail.

You can also stop by Aloqilat Museum and check out its local collection. Although most exhibitions are in Arabic, it is still a cool place to see. It should take about 2 hours to get to Hail, and you should arrive in the city just before sunset.

Before you go to your hotel, make sure you drive up Al Samra Mountain and enjoy the sunset from up there. The entrance fee is 25 SAR, and you can drive all the way to its designated parking spot at the top.

Once you park the car, you will then have to take a free transfer to the observation deck. The car comes every 2 - 3 minutes and you just have to wait by the parking lot. There was not much of a line when I was there, so be careful of people cutting in line.

Once you arrive at the observation deck, you will have a panoramic view of the city of Hail from above. The observation deck faces directly west, so you can witness an incredible sunset here. It gets pretty cold after sundown, so be sure to wear a jacket.

Once done, you can take the shuttle back to the parking lot, drive down, check in to your hotel, grab dinner, and retreat for the day.

Once you are done, it's time to drive to one of the most beautiful places in Saudi Arabia, AlUla, home to the ancient city of Hegra that was built by the Nabateans, who also built the stunning ancient city Petra in Jordan.

The drive should take no more than 5 hours along a desert road. Gas stations are few and far between, so be sure to fill your car up before you leave the city.

Once you arrive in AlUla, you can check into your hotel first and visit Elephant Rock or vice versa. It is a beautiful rock formation that is shaped like an elephant, located in the middle of the desert, and it is beautiful both during the day and at night when it is illuminated by lights. Most prefer it at night, so you can come back here after sunset.

Around 4 PM, be sure to drive up to Harrat Viewpoint, an incredible vantage point located on top of a gigantic sandstone cliff, overlooking the city of AlUla and its surrounding area.

The vantage point from Harrat is incredible. With its 180° view, there is no place where you can take in the stunning natural beauty and incredible geological features of AlUla like this. Despite the sun setting behind the viewpoint, it is still one of the best places to watch the sunset in AlUla.

There is also a cafe at the top with live music and plenty of seats, where you can relax as you wait for the sunset. If you are looking for a place to watch the sunset, be sure to check out Harrat Viewpoint.

After you are done, you can come back to Elephant Rock and see the place at night. It sure gave a different vibe when I visited again after sundown. There are restaurants and cafes with plenty of seats in the middle of the desert where you can enjoy.

Before you go back to your accommodation and retreat for the night, don't forget to wander off behind the Elephant Rock, look up at the sky, and gaze at the stars. A desert is always a great place to go stargazing.

For the next day, you can start exploring the beautiful old town of AlUla starting with Al Jadidah Arts District, a newly developed district adjacent to AlUla's Old Town, and it is a place where the creativity of the locals here shines the most.

Once you are done, you can then proceed to AlUla's Old Town, which is just next to Al Jadidah Arts District. With several mud houses and shops lining both sides of the street, the old town of AlUla really gives off a vibe of being in a Western cowboy movie.

Along both sides of the Old Town's main street, you'll find plenty of shops and stores offering all kinds of goods, from souvenirs to perfumes, and more. You'll also find a selection of really lovely restaurants and cafes that blend seamlessly with the desert surroundings.

You can also go on a guided tour around the Old Town, which will give you access to AlUla Castle as well. The tour should take about 90 minutes, and you can book one online here.

After the old town, you can go on a little adventure and hike the Oasis Heritage Trail, a 10-km long walking trail that will take you through the oasis of AlUla along lush palm-shaded paths and a picture-perfect setting.

Don't worry, you do not have to walk the entire 10-km length. You can do as I did and walk parts of it that begin from this trail head across the road from AlUla's Old Town to Pink Camel Cafe, and do a few detours and see a date farm and the abandoned mud houses nearby.

Spend about an hour or 2 exploring the mud houses along Oasis Heritage Trail, and then head over to Pink Camel Cafe to enjoy lunch before visiting one of the highlights of AlUla, the ancient city of Hegra.

Built by the Nabateans, the same people who gave us Petra in Jordan, Hegra is probably the highlight of my trip to Saudi Arabia. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with over 100 tombs carved into sandstone cliffs located in the middle of the AlUla desert.

The entire area is fenced off, and the only way to visit Hegra is to go on an organized tour run by the government. You can book it online here. Make sure to book in advance, as they have limited spots for each time slot.

The best time to visit Hegra is in the evening, so be sure to book a time slot that is as close to sunset as possible. When I booked the tour in early March, the last time slot of the day was at 2:30 PM, which turned out to be perfect. It took us about 30 minutes to get from the meeting point to Hegra, and we spent about 3 hours exploring the heritage site until 5 PM.

The tour will pick you up from Winter Park, just north of AlUla. You can drive there and park for free at its parking lot.

After you have completed the Hegra Tour, you can head back to AlUla's Old Town and witness how the quiet Old Town comes to life as both local and foreign tourists flock to hang out at cafes and restaurants here. It is such a contrast to the morning and definitely worth checking out again.

For our third day in AlUla, I highly recommend you switch your accommodation and stay at either Caravan by Habitas, Banyan Tree AlUla, or Our Habitas for a night so that you get access to its incredible facilities and tourist attractions that you won't be able to visit without being a guest at these hotels.

With such a high price tag, you are going to get your money's worth by spending the entire of your third day enjoying all the facilities and activities offered for free by Our Habitas.

You can spend the afternoon visiting Maraya, a massive mirrored structure, the largest of its kind in the world, located inside the private land operated by Our Habitas. It is one of the most beautiful buildings you will see in AlUla.

Since it is an art center, at the moment, you will only have access inside the building if there is an event going on and you have a reservation for that event. Even then, just staring at Maraya from the outside is already worth the trip. There's just nothing quite like it.

After that, you can spend the evening enjoying the sunset or joining one of the many daily activities provided by the hotel. When I was there, there were free Yoga classes, an art tour, and an open-air movie theatre you can join.

I stayed at Caravan by Habitas, the cheapest option of all three, which is still pretty pricey at almost 311 USD per night, but think of it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and an entire day worth of activity, and you should feel a bit better. That's how I tricked myself into paying it anyway 😂.

The next morning, you can enjoy the unlimited breakfast at your hotel and visit the stunning pool of Our Habitas hotel to relax there.

You can also grab an e-bike and ride around the property for free, which is pretty fun to do. Once you are done, you can retreat back to your hotel, maybe have another free early lunch around 10:30 AM thanks to its unlimited breakfast, before completing your trip in AlUla and heading over to Medina.

The city used to prohibit non-Muslims from visiting, but in 2021, they relaxed this rule and now anyone is welcome to the city, which is why I have included this in the itinerary. It would be a shame to come all the way to Saudi Arabia and not visit one of the most sacred cities in the world.

As of 2024, you can even go and see the Prophet's Mosque, which was built at the site where Prophet Mohammed passed away. It is the second largest mosque in the world, second only to the grand mosque in Mecca, with a capacity of over a million.

Technically, you are only allowed to see the mosque from the outside, but sometimes the security guard might allow you to enter the fenced area, but not inside the mosque itself.

The rules aren't as clear-cut; however, I was let in at one gate and scolded by a security guard at a different gate, so your mileage may vary. It is important to respect the religion here, so I wouldn't attempt to enter the mosque without permission.

If you want to see the fenced-off area of the mosque without going in, you can also book Dar Al Iman InterContinental Hotel and get a room with a view of the mosque. It's expensive, but it's better than getting scolded by the security there.

Ladies, be sure to wear a headscarf the moment you enter Medina and try to blend in as much as possible the entire time you are in this city. Many people will stare at you in discontent if you don't, as this is the most sacred place here. In other cities, you will be fine without, but Medina is a different story.

Since the Grand Mosque is the only thing to do here, I highly recommend you stay somewhere around the center so you can easily see the mosque. The entire city center gets extremely packed during the evening, which is quite a sight to behold. Once you are done, retreat for the night and prepare for another long drive to Jeddah.

In about 3 hours, you should arrive at Al-Wa'bah Crater. The road is a single lane, but quite empty, and you should be able to drive straight to the crater using the route suggested on Google Maps. Be sure to buy some snacks and lunch for the trip as you won't find much out here.

Once you arrive, you can spend a few hours exploring the crater along the rim walkway. They have built several pavilions along the bridge, so you should be able to enjoy the place and stretch your legs for a bit.

It is now prohibited to descend into the crater due to past incidents where individuals were unable to climb back up due to its slippery and steep nature. A local guy told me that there are still sediments at the center of the crater that could be harmful to your respiratory system, so please refrain from attempting it.

After you are done, you will have to drive another 3-4 hours until you arrive at Jeddah, the crowned jewel of the Red Sea, often referred to as the Dubai of Saudi Arabia. You will appreciate the transition from the sacred city of Medina to the bustling free port of Jeddah. Settle in at your accommodation and rest for the night.

After you are well-rested, it is time to explore the beautiful city of Jeddah, starting with Al Tayabat City Museum, probably the best museum in the city and one that must not be missed. The museum is housed in this impressive multi-complex structure that is unlike anything you have seen before.

Within the museum premises, you will find a handful of narrow alleyways where you can walk around and admire the stunning exterior to your heart's content. From the traditional wooden windows to the old wooden sky bridge, the place really reminded me of my time in Zanzibar, Tanzania, another coastal town that had been heavily influenced by Indian culture.

Once you are ready, you can enter the museum where you will find an impressive amount of in-depth exhibits spread across 3 floors. The museum offers a living history lesson on the foundation of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and the wider Arabian Peninsula.

After you are done at the museum, you can then head over to Old Jeddah, the oldest part of the city with a history dating all the way back to the 7th century.

While you are here, you will be surrounded by some of the most photogenic buildings in Jeddah. Some are undergoing renovation, while others remain relatively untouched with overgrown tree branches, chipped paint, and all. Not everything needs to be completely renovated, in my opinion.

I happened to stumble upon Herbalists Lane by accident as I was exploring Old Jeddah, and I completely fell in love with it instantly. It is a small, narrow alleyway among the maze of Old Town Jeddah, but what makes this different is the whole vibe of it.

If you're looking for a nice and quiet place to enjoy a cup of coffee in Old Jeddah, I highly recommend checking out Roshan Cafe inside Baeshen House. Baeshen House is an old heritage building with a small museum that you can visit for free, but what's really cool is Roshan Café that's inside.

Another tourist attraction in Old Jeddah you shouldn't miss is Nassif House Museum, a massive multi-floor historical house that has been converted into a museum and a cultural center where you can learn about the history of the place.

There are several parking lots around the old town, but almost all of them are now paid. I found this parking lot to be the most convenient, with easy access to the old town. It was also reasonably priced. I believe we paid about 5 SAR for 3 hours via credit card on its website.

There is so much to see and do in Old Jeddah, so I highly recommend you stay until the night when the place is most active if you can. To save on parking, you might consider taking a taxi here and back. It is my favorite area of Jeddah, so you won't regret it.

For the second day, you can start a little later and go for a walk along Jeddah Corniche, a 30 km long coastal recreational area that runs along the coast of the Red Sea.

While you are hanging out at Jeddah Corniche, be sure to drop by and check out Al Rahmah Mosque, best known as the floating mosque. It is a beautiful mosque built on stilts and marked by its bright white color and its turquoise dome.

In the evening, head over to Middle Corniche Park or Al-Hamra Corniche and see King Fahad's Fountain, a massive fountain that jets water as high as 260 meters (853 ft), making it one of the highest in the world.

For the third day here, you can spend the rest of the day at your own leisure. I know how taxing it is to drive around Saudi Arabia, and trust me, you are going to appreciate a day where you do not have to drive very far. Maybe check out the Red Sea Mall.

Try the famous Al-Baik Fast Food chain and taste some of their delicious fried chicken and chicken nuggets. You should be able to find one at the food court inside Red Sea Mall. Enjoy a night out in Jeddah before retreating for the night and preparing for the next day. Looking for more things to do in Jeddah? Check out:9 BEST Things to Do in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia

The village was named after the water that flows from the nearby mountains. There is a local legend that tells of a man who lost his stick in one of the valleys. In his attempt to retrieve it, he followed the river until he arrived at the village. There, he gathered its people and excavated until he extracted the stick from the spring.

You can read the history of the place and all its legends at the Visitor Center at the bottom of the village. The village is free to enter and although there is nothing inside the houses here, it is still worth the climb for the view over the area.

It is quite a bit of a hike and can take about 10 - 15 minutes to reach the top, so be sure to pack some water with you. Since we will be staying in Al Bahah tonight, you have plenty of time to visit Thee Ain village.

You can come back and check the place out in the evening as I heard it is beautifully illuminated at night, if you don't mind driving the mountain road between Al Bahah and Thee Ain at night.

Along the mountain road, you will find Rijal Almaa Museum, an incredible piece of architecture that has stood the test of time for more than 900 years.

It is a village turned museum, highly influenced by Yemeni culture, which is clearly visible in its unique architectural style, reminiscent of those found in the Old Quarter of Sana'a, the capital city of Yemen.

Despite certain areas being converted into a museum, you will still find people living in some of the houses here. It is said that there are around 60 multi-story buildings here, all made of stone, clay, and wood.

You will have to pay the entrance fee of 20 SAR per person to enter the structure. Inside, there is a small museum that contains old tools, weapons, and a few costumes. It's not particularly special, but you can hike up further to get a nice view of the village from above.

There is also a cafe here as well as shops selling snacks and souvenirs in case you haven't bought one along the way. If you don't want to pay the entrance fee, you can also appreciate the museum from the outside. It is quite a sight to behold!

Once you are done, you can continue your way up the mountain to Abha. This is the most scenic part of the road trip, but also the most dangerous, with its steep climb and several hairpin turns, so be extremely careful here.

The road will take you all the way up to almost 2,400 meters. It takes about 45 minutes to drive all the way up to the top. We drove up with a regular sedan car (Toyota Yaris), and it was fine, but we were definitely pushing it to its limit with all the climbs we were doing.

Thankfully, there are a few rest stops that are worth visiting along the way. One is this viewpoint, located at one of the hairpin turns up the mountain, and you will get an incredible view of the valley below.

I was there at sunset, and it was incredible. There were also baboons everywhere, hanging out on the mountain, waiting for locals to feed them. They can get quite aggressive when they see anything that could be food, so do not have anything dangling around with you when you get out of the car.

Also, do not feed them; just like the monkeys in Thailand, that is how they become more and more aggressive towards humans. As long as you don't have anything that looks like food, they won't bother you.

Once you are done, drive all the way up to the top and you should find another great viewpoint with a clear view of the serpentine road that you just drove up. Don't forget to stop here.

Last but not least, the highest viewpoint here will provide you with an incredible vantage point over the western side of the mountain, making it a perfect spot to watch the sunset. All three viewpoints are truly worth a visit, so be sure to keep an eye out for them! Bring your jackets too as it can be extremely cold up here.

Once you are done, you can descend to Abha and spend the night in the city. The next day, you can explore Abha, visit Shamsan Historical Castle, Abha Lake, and The Art Street at night, or you can just relax for the entire day before you head home.

On your last day, return your car to the rental place at Abha International Airport. Spare at least 3.5 hours before your flight because the car inspection might take 30 minutes and you should have time to dispute any extra costs they might throw at you at the end. Also, Abha airport is not particularly well organized, and you might find yourself having to queue up to check in for quite some time. We waited for an hour just to get our bag checked, so be sure to be at the airport early.

And that is it! You have completed a 2-week road trip around Saudi Arabia! Not many people will have the time and energy to do this epic itinerary, so congratulations! Enjoy the trip of your lifetime and stay safe!

I would avoid visiting Saudi Arabia in the summer months as, like most Gulf Countries, it can get extremely hot and humid. So much so that you wouldn't be able to do anything during the day, which is not ideal for such an action-packed itinerary that we have here. How to Get to Saudi Arabia? From the US, there are only a handful of direct flights from the US to Saudi Arabia, such as the one from JFK to Riyadh operated by Saudia Airlines. But if you don't mind transiting, you should be able to find flights for your city to Riyadh via Emirates, Etihad, and Royal Jordan Air.

From Europe, you can also take one of the many direct flights leaving from cities like Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and London to Riyadh via Saudi Airlines, KLM, or other local airlines. From Asia, the same applies to most direct flights operated by Saudi Airlines. You can also fly via Emirates and Etihad if you don't mind transiting through the UAE. To find a cheap flight to Saudi Arabia, I would recommend you use Skyscanner or Expedia to look for the cheapest route and schedule so you can compare and pick the best one. How to Get Around Saudi Arabia? For this itinerary, you are going to need to rent a car and drive since we will be covering more than 2,700 km, visiting far and wide.

Relying on public transportation between cities is only applicable if you just want to visit Jeddah, Medina, and Mecca (for Muslims only) as they are connected via a high-speed rail line, but that is pretty much it for Saudi Arabia. Within the city, you can also take Uber or Careem, but taxis are pretty expensive here, and you will save more money by renting a car and driving yourself.

Gas is cheap at around 1.9 - 2 SAR per liter, and it should cost no more than 84 SAR (223 USD) to fill up the 42-liter tank capacity of a Toyota Yaris entirely. There are 2 notable car rental companies I recommend, Yelo and Keys, both are locals. Yelo is a bit more expensive, but they are highly praised and are more professional to deal with. Keys are cheaper, but I had a few issues with them. When Keys delivered the car to me, the car's interior was quite dirty. When we returned the car at another branch, they charged us 57 SAR for the stains that came with the car (not caused by us).

We forgot to record a video inside the car as proof when we got it, so we had to bite the bullet and pay. So don't make the same mistake as I did and record both the exterior and interior of the car when you get it from the car rental place. For 14 days, you can expect to pay around 1,000 USD for car rental with an open-mile policy and full insurance. You are going to need this insurance as without the open-mile, you are limited to traveling only around 200 km per day, which is not enough to cover this itinerary. Saudi Arabia is way too big for a daily mile limit.

You also need full insurance as the Saudi roads are a complete jungle out here. Everyone drives like their houses are on fire here. Tailgating and sweeping across 4 lanes without turn signals are extremely common, and you are mostly at the behest of other drivers. I have highlighted quite extensively why here, so be sure to check that out. Oh, and there are also risks of sandstorms, so it is always a good idea to go with full insurance.

You could also rely on international car rental places like Hertz or Budget, but you might not be able to return the car at a different location, so be sure to look into that first. For this itinerary, you are going to have to return the car at a different location since our trip starts in Riyadh and ends in Abha, so don't forget to pick that option. Both companies allow a different drop-off location, and they both have a branch at Abha International Airport, so you are good to go.

How Much Money Do I Need For A 2-Week Trip To Saudi Arabia? From this 2-week itinerary, we can calculate approximately how much money you will be spending here as follows: Accommodation: You can expect to spend around 835 USD minimum for 14 days' worth of accommodation. Food: For 14 days, you can expect to pay around 336 USD for food at regular restaurants.

Transportation: For this itinerary, you can expect to pay around 1100 USD for transportation with the car rental being 1,000 USD including open-mile, different drop-off locations, and full insurance. 100 USD is for gas for the entire 14-day road trip. Activities: Depending on how much you want to follow my itinerary, you can expect to pay around 200 SAR (53 USD) for activities, including entrance fees for tourist attractions, tours, etc.

Riyadh Metro,"Rapid transit system in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

The Riyadh Metro (Arabic: قطار الرياض, romanized: Qiṭār Ar-riyāḍ, Najdi Arabic pronunciation: [gɪ.ˈtˤaːr ər.rɪ.ˈjaːðˤ]) is a rapid transit system serving Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Part of the King Abdulaziz Project for Riyadh Public Transport, it is the longest driverless metro in the world and was opened in December 2024.[1]

The system consists of six lines connecting 85 stations spanning a combined length of 176 kilometers (109 mi). This is the second metro system in Saudi Arabia, after the Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Metro in Mecca, the fourth on the Arabian Peninsula, sixth in the Arab World, and fifteenth in the Middle East. The project cost $22.5 billion to build.[2]

History [ edit ]

In June 2013, a shortlist of three major global consortia was chosen to build the metro.[3] Contracts were awarded in July 2013, with construction planned to start in 2014 and take 4 years.[4] The groundbreaking ceremony was celebrated on April 4, 2014.[5] It was built by construction companies including Bechtel, Almabani General Contractors, Consolidated Contractors Company, Strukton, Webuild, Larsen & Toubro, Samsung C&T, and Nesma.[6]

Consortia [ edit ]

BACS: Bechtel / Almabani / CCC / Siemens

ANM: (Arriyadh New Mobility): Webuild (at the time of signature, Impregilo, then Salini-Impregilo) / Bombardier / Ansaldo / Larsen & Toubro / Nesma & Partners / WorleyParsons / IDOM

FAST: FCC / Atkins / Alstom / Samsung C&T / Strukton / TYPSA (Tecnica Y Proyectos)

The new project is expected to be the centerpiece of the city's public transport system, integrated with an 85-kilometre (53 mi) three-line bus rapid transit (BRT) network.[7] The project will contribute to reducing the number of car trips by nearly 250 thousand trips a day, equivalent to 400 thousand liters of fuel per day, thus reducing the air pollutant emissions in the city. It is expected that the capacity of the project will reach 3.6 million passengers a day.[8]

In February 2018, Riyadh governor, Prince Faisal bin Bandar, stated that 68% of the project has been finished and that the metro will start demo runs in late September 2018.[9] In March 2018, the Saudi economy minister Mohammad Al Tuwaijri commented at the Saudi-UK CIO Forum in London that a soft opening is planned for 2019 (June–August) and the full availability of the system is expected in 2021.[10] In December 2021, it was announced that more than 90% of the project had been completed, with testing well underway.[11]

The project was originally led by Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz Al Saud,[7] former governor of Riyadh and chairman of the Riyadh Development Authority, and is now led by Faisal bin Bandar Al Saud, the current governor of Riyadh.

Opening of metro [ edit ]

Riyadh metro was inaugurated by King Salman on 27 November 2024.[12] The opening of the metro system – featuring lines 1, 4, and 6 – took place on 1 December 2024.[13] Lines 2 and 5 were opened two weeks later on 15 December with the final line – line 3 – opening on 5 January 2025.[14] On 11 December 2024, it was reported that the metro has garnered 1.9 million passengers in the first week of operation.[15] By early January 2025, the metro system was confirmed to be fully operational after the launch of the Orange Line (Line 3).[16]

Corruption allegations [ edit ]

In 2017, prince Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud was arrested as part of the 2017 Saudi Arabian purge. Part of the allegations against him, was that he, as Riyadh Governor, had awarded contracts for the Riyadh Metro to his own companies.[17]

Line 7 (Gold Line) is a proposed line set to link all King Khalid International Airport terminals down to Qiddiya, the line will pass through Misk City, New Muraaba, Diriyah and King Abdullah International Gardens.[20]

Expansion of Line 2 [ edit ]

A proposed expansion to Line 2 is to cover the western side of King Saud University, possibly the Diplomatic Quarter and end it at Diriyah where some stations already began construction.[21]

Stations [ edit ]

The system consists of 85 stations, including a number of interchange stations.[22] Naming rights for 15 out of the 85 stations are planned to be awarded by the Royal Commission for Riyadh City. These rights include space for shops and advertising within the stations.[23]

The vehicles and stations are monitored by cameras, early warning systems, and communication systems that are directly connected to the main control center. The main stations are characterized by monorail sites designed in several levels. These sites are air-conditioned, taking into account the comfort and safety of passengers. The stations also use solar cells technology to save about 20% of the power required for air-conditioning and lighting.[24]

KAFD Metro Station [ edit ]

The KAFD (King Abdullah Financial District) station covers an area of 8,150 m2 (87,700 sq ft). The station is located east of the Financial District, along King Fahd Road near its intersection with the Northern Ring Road. It connects metro lines 1, 4, 6, and the KAFD's monorail. The station is designed by Zaha Hadid Architects from the UK.[24]

National Museum Station [ edit ]

National Museum Station is the second largest and one of the most iconic stations on the Riyadh Metro. As one of the four transfer stations on Line 1, National Museum Station is where Line 1 and Line 5 meet. The station is located in the Al Batha area of Riyadh. The gross floor area (GFA) of the station itself is about 72'000 m2. The station's external envelope is designed to replicate Saudi Arabia's mountainous region, with a unique double skin facade, internal blue panels replicating the sky and external concrete panels through which the blue can be seen, to represent the mountains. The station is unique in that it also has a new bus terminal adjacent, the design of which is to replicate a Bedouin tent.[citation needed]

STC Station [ edit ]

STC Metro station is one of the four main transportation stations in the Riyadh Metro. Gerber Architekten won the competition for the metro station in 2012. It was originally planned to be named Olaya Metro station. Construction started in 2014 and was planned to be completed in 2019. This station allows access for Line 1 and Line 2 trains. The gross floor area (GFA) is about 97,000 m2 (1,040,000 sq ft). It is located on the intersection of King Abdullah Road with King Fahad Road and Olaya Street. Its design proposes the idea of Public gardens that extend over the entire area of the station. Metro customers are invited to use the public gardens. The gardens are characterized by palm trees erected on top of the station, designated picnic areas, and WiFi coverage. Stairs, lifts, and escalators connect all the levels allowing access to everyone including people with special needs. There is also a public parking located underneath the plaza. Recently the initial plan has been changed and no longer features gardens on the roof and is now rectangular in shape though it still has all the other features. In 2018, the station was named STC station after the Saudi Telecom Company.[25]

Western Metro Station [ edit ]

The station covers an area of 12,500 m2 (135,000 sq ft). The station is located on the land currently used for the Central Vegetable Market of Al-Suwaidi Al-Gharbi. The station will be composed of a bus route and a link to Line 3. Omrania & Associates has won the competition to design the western metro station.[24][26]

Qasr Al-Hukm Metro Station [ edit ]

This station covers an area of 19,600 m2 (211,000 sq ft) and will connect Line 1 and Line 3 trains. Snøhetta from Norway had won the competition to design the Qasr Al-Hukm Metro Station.[24]

Incidents and accidents [ edit ]

Just 6 days after the Riyadh Metro opened, the Blue Line faced some technical issues after someone tampered with the emergency switch on the train, causing the line to halt between STC and Alinma Bank Stations. Riyadh Metro said that shuttle buses were deployed between the two to avoid further disruption.[24][27]

Mecca Metro,"Rapid transit in Saudi Arabia

The Mecca Metro or Makkah Metro is a metro system with four planned lines in the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The Metro was constructed by China Railway Construction Corporation[3] and is run by Mecca Mass Rail Transit Company (MMRTC). The metro forms part of the 62-billion-riyal Mecca Public Transport Programme (MPTP), which will include integrated bus services.[1][4][5]

The four proposed metro lines[5] will be in addition to the existing Al Mashaer Al Mugaddassah Metro line: 18.1 km, connecting Mecca, Arafat, Muzdalifa, and Mina opened in November 2010.[6][7]

Many people utilize the Mecca Metro during the Hajj. The price for the metro is 250 riyals, with prices lowering to 100 riyals if traveling on the last day of Hajj.[8]

Planning [ edit ]

In August 2012, it was announced that the Saudi government had approved a US$16.5 billion budget to build four metro lines (182 kilometers (113 mi)) of the system.[9] The announcement gave an estimated time period to completion of 10 years. Invitations for tenders were due to be issued in January 2013.[10]

Four new lines are to be built.[11]

Line A : will connect Mecca to large multilevel parking facilities from the south to the northeast.

: will connect Mecca to large multilevel parking facilities from the south to the northeast. Line B : is a straight link between Mina and Mecca and continues parallel to the HHSR into the southwest.

: will connect Arafat and Mina to the west side of Mecca and continues to the northwest. Line D : will connect the south to Mecca with a straight extension to the west. [ 12 ]

Work on the 188-kilometer (117 mi) long metro network with 87 new stations had been expected to commence construction in 2015,[1] then in 2016,[2] but had not started ever since. After a failed tender in 2017,[13] the Saudi government restarted the project in summer 2024 by ordering a feasibility study on phase 1 of the project. This phase with a US$8 billion budget covers planned line B and most parts of line C, while line A will be in the second phase, and line D plus a northern extension of line C will be part of phase 3.[12]

MMRTC has appointed Prasarana Malaysia to provide consultancy services during Phase 1, which covers the construction of two metro lines; totaling 45.1 km and 22 stations by 2019.[4][needs update]

"Best Transport Options in Makkah, Madinah, Saudi Arabia","Best Transport Options in Makkah, Madinah, Saudi Arabia

Makkah and Madinah, in the heart of Saudi Arabia, are cities rich in spiritual and cultural heritage, attracting millions annually. Navigating these cities is now more accessible due to recent advancements in transportation infrastructure. This guide will help you navigate Makkah and Madinah’s transport options, ensuring a smooth and enriching visit.

The expansion of public transport in Makkah and Madinah, supported by government initiatives, has made reaching holy sites easier, particularly during peak times like Ramadan and the Hajj season.

Visitors in Makkah, Madinah, and Riyadh can choose from a variety of transport methods, including flights, car rentals, trains, buses, and taxis for both local and national travel.

1. Buses in Saudi Arabia

The most affordable method to travel from one place to the next is via bus. The Saudi Arabian Public Transport Company (SAPTCO) operates an efficient, clean, air-conditioned bus service.

The bus stops are spread across the city and can easily be found on a map. Some drivers give out free water, especially during the scorching heat of the summertime.

Intercity buses are also available between the cities of Saudi Arabia. They provide an hourly service between Jeddah and Medinah and also a regular service between Makkah and Medina. Tickets for long-distance travel can be purchased through SAPTCO’s website or at a ticketing agency or through SAPTCO’s mobile apps. You can find bus schedules here.

The city of Makkah, Madinah, and Riyadh also has a network of local public buses that connect the most important destinations around the city.

Bus passengers pay for their fares with the SAPTCO rechargeable smart card. The smart card’s cost is SAR 10, while the cost of a single journey on a bus is SAR 3. Recharging your SAPTCO smart card is possible at a ticket vending machine, via the SAPTCO app, as well by talking to an operator on the bus.

The company also runs international journeys to the UAE and Bahrain, which you can book online.

Private Buses For Pilgrims

Air-conditioned, high-quality buses run by private companies (such as Rawahel and Hafil) operate specific routes during the Umrah and Hajj seasons.

General Syndicate of Cars Buses operating during the Hajj only, runs several thousand buses transporting pilgrims between the various holy sites.

2. Taxis and ride-hailing services in Saudi Arabia

If you want to spend a bit more you can take taxis. Taxis are available in any city around the Kingdom. There are plenty of taxis outside the airport and they’re also easy to find in the city center.

There are several ride-hailing apps that work across Saudi Arabia, which should make getting a taxi a lot easier in all of the major cities throughout the Kingdom. The most popular ride-hailing apps among locals are Careem and Uber. Local rivals comprise Hala Taxi and Kaiian.

Uber is the biggest ride-hailing service in the nation and is available in numerous cities which include Jeddah, Mecca, Medina, and Riyadh. Careem also has a presence across Saudi Arabia and provides intercity rides between Jeddah, Mecca, and Medina.

Fares are supposed to be based on meters, but this is not always the case. If a meter isn’t utilized, be sure to be able to agree on a price prior to starting your journey.

Since the majority of people who visit Makkah, Madinah will be either on the Hajj or Umrah pilgrimage, they are likely to take taxis. The usual price is determined in advance or booked through the hotel concierge, who will inform you of the cost.

During the last 10 days of Ramadan and during the Hajj time of the year, prices may be three times higher because of the demand and the congestion of traffic.

Drivers rarely speak English, therefore, having a map with the destination marked is a great idea or learning some basic Arabic and Urdu.

3. Car Rentals

It is possible to rent vehicles while touring the country. GCC citizens and visitors who have international driving licenses and expatriates living in the Kingdom are able to rent vehicles from various rental offices.

Talk to your travel agent or the airport prior to your departure for your destination to confirm there is a car for you during your stay.

Passports, as well as other documents, will be checked by the company prior to giving keys to the customer, therefore, make sure you have all the necessary documents. Before taking a ride, be sure to inspect the car you’re taking from inside and outside; choosing a car in perfect condition is strongly recommended.

While driving be aware and patient. The roads are usually busy and the speed of traffic is slow. Before you hop in your rental, check out the map to ensure that you know where you’re going.

People who plan to take part in Umrah together with their family members prefer renting a car so that getting within the city is more convenient. Public transportation is an alternative, but it doesn’t give the flexibility to travel in accordance with your timetable and timing.

4. Trains in Saudi Arabia

Train travel is another form of transportation available throughout the country. Saudi Arabia Railways (الشركة السعودية للخطوط الحديدية) runs three passenger routes:

Riyadh-Qurayyat Line, an intercity service connecting Riyadh, Hofuf (ٱلْهُفُوف), Abqaiq (بقيق), and Dammam (الدمام) High-speed service running between Makkah (مكة), Jeddah (جدة), KAEC, and Madinah (المدينة) Night trains run between Riyadh (الرياض‎), Al Majma’ah (المجمعة), Al-Qassim (منطقة القصيم), Ḥaʼil (حَائِل‎), Sakākā (سَكَاكَا‎), and Qurayyat (القريات‎)

Tickets on Saudi Arabian Railways are priced according to distance. Their carriages are divided into two classes which are: business and economy. You can check ticket prices online by searching for the destination you want to go to. You can also purchase your tickets in person at the train station, or via phone.

Al Haramain High-Speed Train

Also known as the Makkah-Medina High-Speed railway, the new Al Haramain train starts operating at the beginning of 2018. It will shorten the journey from Makkah to Medina from 6 hours to 2.5 hours. The train travels through Jeddah and Rabigh.

Tickets are classified into three categories classes: business class and first class, and tourists class. You can check tickets here

5. METRO

The single line referred to locally as the Al Mashaaer Al Mugaddassah Line (قطار المشاعر المقدسة الخط الجنوبي) or simply Line S, is a nine-station line that operates only during the Hajj pilgrimage.

Line S transporting thousands of pilgrims quickly and easily between Makkah and Mount Arafat, Muzdalifah and Mina.

Even though it is only operational for a week every year, Line S is able to transport an astonishing 3.5 million people during the Hajj.

6. Travelling by Air

There are more than 30 airports throughout the country, as well as flying is the easiest and most convenient method of domestic travel.

Saudia is a state-owned carrier in Saudi Arabia, while Nesma Airlines also has routes within Saudi Arabia. Low-cost airlines in Saudi Arabia include flyadeal and Flynas.

The transformation of transport systems in Makkah and Madinah goes beyond technological advancement; it mirrors Saudi Arabia’s commitment to ensuring a seamless and accessible journey for all visitors. Whether you’re a pilgrim on a spiritual quest or a traveler exploring the historical and cultural wonders of these cities, the variety and efficiency of transportation options promise not only a memorable trip but also comfort and ease. As you prepare for your visit to Makkah and Madinah, you can look forward to a journey that’s as rewarding as the destination itself."
Transportation in Jeddah,"Individual Transport

In Jeddah, as in all Saudi cities, cars, trucks and buses are still the main means of passenger and freight transport. The private car is the most widely used means of transportation, and the city is accordingly crisscrossed by wide, sometimes ten-lane roads and avenues.

Interregional connections to and from Jeddah are also well developed. Highway 40, which begins in Jeddah, connects the city with Mecca, Riyadh and Dammām on the east coast.

By contrast, the city is not yet made for pedestrians and cyclists, not only because of the lack of sidewalks and bike paths, but also because of the hot climatic conditions that make riding in air-conditioned vehicles irreplaceable for the foreseeable future.

Taxis and On-Demand Driving Services

Cabs are a very popular means of transportation if you don’t want to use the more expensive limousine service arranged esp. by hotels. The white and green cabs are operated by different companies; the green cabs are usually somewhat larger, better and cleaner than the white cabs – but as everywhere applies: the exception proves the rule. Many cab drivers come from Yemen.

In principle, the same applies as for cab traffic in Riyadh; for simplicity, please refer to the Riyadh section of this blog.

There is also Uber and Careem transportation, but they do not accept cash payments.

Bus Transport, Metro

City bus service is provided by SAPTCO from 5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. (www.saptco.com.sa; or Rekab app) on six routes at 10- to 35-minute intervals. Most buses are equipped with electronic payment systems. Citizens from non-GCC countries need the original residence permit or a valid passport for visitors to use the bus system.

A Metro system does not yet exist.

Railroads

The high-speed Haramain Train is already in operation, covering the region between Jeddah and Makkah. The total length of the new passenger rail line is about 480 km (298 mi). The line so far includes five stations, one in Makkah, two in Jeddah City – one in the KAIA Airport and the other in the city center, Al-Sulimaniyah station – an additional station in Madinah, and the fifth station in King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC).

The railroad line mainly serves pilgrims coming for Hajj or Umrah. The new line reduces travel time between Jeddah and Makkah to less than half an hour, while the 410-km route between holy Makkah and Madinah now takes about two and a half hours. www.sar.hhr.sa;

Madinah Bus Rapid Transit Project to transform Mobility in Saudi Arabia,"Madinah Bus Rapid Transit Project to transform Mobility in Saudi Arabia

In a bid to revolutionise transportation in the holy city of Madinah, the Al Madinah Region Development Authority (MDA) has awarded a landmark contract to an Egis-led joint venture (JV), signalling a major leap forward for Saudi Arabia’s ambitious Vision 2030.

This project, centred on the development of a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, is set to transform how residents, visitors, and pilgrims navigate the city, playing a crucial role in alleviating traffic congestion and enhancing the overall transportation infrastructure.

The Madinah BRT system, which aligns with the broader Pilgrim Experience Program under Vision 2030, aims to not only improve transport for locals but also accommodate millions of pilgrims visiting the holy sites annually. The long-term goal? To establish up to 500 stations and achieve 80-90% area coverage in Madinah by 2030. By doing so, the city is poised to become a beacon of sustainable, efficient urban mobility in the region.

The Role of Egis-Led JV in the BRT Project

Egis, a global leader in engineering and operational services, in collaboration with Systra, will be responsible for providing Project Management and Construction Management (PMCM) services for this ambitious initiative. This isn’t just a routine infrastructure project; it’s a comprehensive overhaul of Madinah’s public transportation network. The Egis-led JV’s remit spans from design and engineering supervision to overseeing construction, testing, and operation of the entire bus network.

Their services also include the management of safety and security across all facets of the project—from buses and depots to intelligent transportation systems (ITS), bus lanes, footbridges, and park-and-ride facilities. The meticulous oversight ensures that every aspect of the network is executed with precision, safety, and sustainability in mind.

“This project is not just about building a transport system. It’s about creating a smart, sustainable, and efficient network that will serve millions of people annually, enhancing their journey through the holy city,” says a representative from Egis.

Vision 2030 and the Pilgrim Experience Program

Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 sets the tone for the country’s transformation, seeking to diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on oil. Central to this vision is the Pilgrim Experience Program, designed to streamline travel for the millions of pilgrims who visit Saudi Arabia each year. Madinah, being one of Islam’s holiest cities, is a cornerstone of this program.

The Madinah BRT project directly supports this vision, offering pilgrims a fast, reliable, and safe mode of transportation. In a city where religious tourism dominates, efficient transport systems are crucial, not just for the convenience of visitors, but for maintaining the flow of people in and out of key religious sites, such as the Prophet’s Mosque. As the project progresses, the BRT system is expected to ease the stress on the city’s existing infrastructure, making Madinah more accessible and manageable during peak pilgrimage seasons.

The Benefits of Bus Rapid Transit for Madinah

The BRT system is designed to offer a rapid, efficient alternative to traditional public transport, with dedicated lanes that allow buses to bypass traffic congestion. This will be especially beneficial in a city that sees a massive influx of visitors, particularly during Hajj and Umrah seasons.

Some key benefits of the BRT system include:

Reduced traffic congestion: Dedicated bus lanes will prevent buses from getting caught in gridlock, ensuring smooth operations and faster travel times.

Environmental sustainability: By reducing reliance on personal vehicles and encouraging the use of public transport, the BRT system is expected to decrease carbon emissions and contribute to a cleaner urban environment.

Enhanced safety: The project includes state-of-the-art safety features, from ITS to advanced operational systems, ensuring the safe transport of passengers.

The Egis-led JV will oversee these enhancements, ensuring they are implemented efficiently and effectively, cementing Madinah’s status as a city equipped to handle its ever-growing population of residents and visitors.

Engineering Excellence and Technological Innovation

The scope of the Egis-Systra JV’s responsibilities doesn’t end with traditional project management. The consortium is also tasked with ensuring that cutting-edge technology is incorporated into the design and operation of the BRT system. This includes the deployment of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which will streamline the movement of buses, enhance safety measures, and provide real-time data on traffic conditions.

The BRT will also include modern features such as priority lanes, automated ticketing, and feeder services to connect with other forms of public transportation. These advancements not only make travel more convenient for passengers but also ensure that the system operates efficiently, reducing wait times and optimising routes based on demand.

Civil Infrastructure and Sustainability Goals

While buses and operational systems are at the heart of the BRT network, the development of supporting infrastructure is equally crucial. The Egis-led JV is responsible for overseeing the construction of bus lanes, stations, footbridges, and park-and-ride facilities. These facilities will be designed with accessibility and sustainability in mind, providing seamless integration with the city’s existing infrastructure.

The project also aligns with Saudi Arabia’s environmental goals. The increased use of public transport, coupled with the introduction of eco-friendly buses, is expected to significantly reduce the city’s carbon footprint. This reflects the kingdom’s broader commitment to sustainable development, as outlined in Vision 2030.

“Sustainability is at the core of this project. By reducing reliance on personal vehicles and enhancing public transport, we’re not only easing congestion but also making a positive environmental impact,” states an Egis project manager.

A Bright Future for Transportation in Saudi Arabia

With the backing of the Saudi government and the expertise of the Egis-Systra JV, the Madinah BRT project is poised to set a new standard for urban transportation in the Middle East. As the project progresses, it promises to not only transform how people travel in the holy city but also serve as a model for future developments across the kingdom.

This BRT system is just the beginning. Saudi Arabia’s commitment to overhauling its transportation infrastructure is part of a much larger vision. As Vision 2030 unfolds, we can expect to see more projects like this, aimed at creating smart, sustainable cities that cater to both residents and visitors.

A Project With Lasting Impact

The Madinah BRT project, guided by the expertise of the Egis-led JV, represents a significant step forward in Saudi Arabia’s transportation evolution. It’s not just about moving people from point A to point B; it’s about creating a system that enhances the quality of life for everyone—residents, visitors, and pilgrims alike.

With a focus on sustainability, efficiency, and safety, this project will leave a lasting impact on the city of Madinah, setting the stage for future developments across Saudi Arabia."

Riyadh Metro’s Long-Awaited Beginning

Riyadh Metro’s journey started in 2014, driven by a vision to redefine urban transportation in Saudi Arabia. Initially planned to open within four years, construction faced delays, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2021, testing began on select lines, giving residents a glimpse of what was to come. Finally, on December 1, 2024, the first three of six lines—Lines 1, 4, and 6—opened to the public, sparking excitement across the city.

Within days, the Metro became the talk of the town. Residents left their cars behind to explore this new mode of transport, from students commuting to classes to professionals heading to work. More lines are on the horizon, with Lines 2 and 5 set to open on December 15, 2024, and Line 3 expected to follow on January 5, 2025.

The Riyadh Metro sets a benchmark in modern public transport in Saudi Arabia, combining cutting-edge facilities with an eco-conscious design. Fully automated trains ensure efficiency and comfort, offering separate carriages for families, single riders, and first-class passengers. Inside the stations, solar panels generate 20% of the energy needs, making the system environmentally sustainable.

With the Metro expected to eliminate 250,000 car trips daily and save 400,000 liters of fuel, it’s not just convenient—it’s essential for Riyadh’s future. Key hubs like the King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) Station, Western Station, Qasr Al-Hukm District Station, and STC Station serve as major transit points, providing amenities such as parking, retail shops, and spacious, air-conditioned waiting areas.

A Closer Look at the Metro Stations

Each Riyadh Metro station is an architectural and functional masterpiece that reflects Saudi Arabia’s commitment to modernization while honoring its cultural roots. The design of the stations combines innovation with elements inspired by traditional Saudi architecture.

For example, mashrabiya-inspired facades not only provide aesthetic appeal but also improve energy efficiency by offering shade and controlling natural light. Some stations, such as the iconic King Abdullah Financial District (KAFD) Metro Station, feature intricate lattice-like exteriors inspired by desert landscapes, which also enhance structural integrity and environmental performance.

Inside the stations, the facilities cater to every traveler’s comfort and convenience. Stations are fully air-conditioned and equipped with state-of-the-art amenities such as free Wi-Fi, multilingual signage, and ample seating areas.

Accessibility is a key focus, with escalators, elevators, and ramps designed to accommodate passengers with reduced mobility. Beyond functionality, the stations are a cultural experience, featuring art installations and architectural details inspired by Saudi heritage, making them more than just transit hubs.

Energy efficiency and sustainability are at the forefront of Riyadh Metro’s design. Solar panels integrated into the stations contribute up to 20% of their energy needs. Sliding door panels on platforms help conserve cool air, while advanced cooling systems automatically adjust based on passenger density. These features have earned facilities like the KAFD Metro Station a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification.

Strategically located stations such as Western Station and Qasr Al-Hukm District Station serve as major transit and community hubs. They offer conveniences like parking, retail spaces, and air-conditioned waiting areas, creating a seamless and enjoyable experience for passengers.
