There are organized trips to historical sites, sports competitions, and other recreational activities. Dinner parties, desert trips, and beach parties are common. There are concerts at embassies and expatriate-operated amateur theater and musical ensembles. And in the last few years, cinemas, Western concerts, Western sporting events, etc., have become common. See our video or article Having Fun in Saudi Arabia Where will my new friends and colleagues be from? The expatriate community in Saudi Arabia is made up of citizens from around the world: Americans, Canadians, Australians, British, German, Irish, Egyptians, Indians, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Malaysians, South Africans, etc. In 2020, the CIA World Factbook estimated Saudi Arabia's population to be 34 million, of which around 38% are expatriates. What types of sports are available? There are endless opportunities to get and stay fit. There are organized athletic events, such as tennis, ball hockey, running, rugby, and soccer. There are also marathons and desert camping . Fitness clubs are available but can be costly, so most people stick with the pool facilities, gyms, and tennis courts commonly available on the hospital grounds or in housing complexes. There are grass and sand golf courses, such as at the Intercontinental Hotel (where both men and women play). Is drinking alcohol legal in Saudi Arabia? Things are changing! In February 2024, it was announced that an alcohol shop would be opened in Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter. (As of February 2024, this is the only shop of which we are aware.) Is smoking cigarettes legal in Saudi Arabia? Smoking is legal in Saudi Arabia, but women cannot smoke in public. Are there any types of books, CDs, or DVDs that are illegal in Saudi Arabia? Do not bring books which are critical of Saudi Arabia or which are politically controversial into the country. Pornography is strictly prohibited. Travel guides about Saudi Arabia are completely acceptable. If your books have covers or pictures that may be offensive, remove them. DVDs may be checked at customs. Is English-language reading material available? There main English papers are Arab News and Saudi Gazette. There are several English-language bookstores, but the stock can vary. There are book-sharing clubs among expats and small libraries at the hospital. Books can also be ordered online from websites such as Amazon.com. An eReader, such as Kindle, is also an option. What is the food like? Saudi Arabia allows expatriates to go on a culinary world tour. In addition to sampling authentic Middle Eastern cuisine (such as tabouleh, hummus, pita, baba ghanoush, etc.), there is Italian, French, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Filipino, Mexican, Turkish, and Indian. For a taste of ""home,"" the standard American chains such as McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Dunkin' Donuts, and Dairy Queen are available. Many of the foods in the supermarket will be familiar to you, from ketchup to Twinkies to skim milk. Although produce is readily available at supermarkets, fruit and vegetable souqs (markets) also provide excellent fresh produce. Alcohol and pork products are not permitted. What is available in the stores? Most things that are available in North America are available in Saudi Arabia, with the exception of items that are prohibited, such as alcohol, pornography, and pork products. Pharmacies are open at convenient times, and many pharmaceuticals can be obtained over the counter.

High-end designer clothing and sportswear items are easy to find, but you can't always try them on! The country also has many good tailors who can make items for you.

It can be difficult to find bathing suits — even more so when there is a chance you might not be able to try it on — so bring a couple from home.

Electronics stores abound, selling the latest in computer, audio, and video equipment. Videos and DVDs are also available, but many of these will have been censored.

Jewelry shopping in the gold souqs is so popular with expatriates that most leave Saudi Arabia with a sizeable gold collection. What languages are spoken in Riyadh, Jeddah, Jubail, Dhahran, etc.? The official language is Arabic. English is commonly spoken, and Hindi, Urdu, and Tagalog are also spoken by many of the expatriates who live there. English is the language of operation of all hospitals and translators are available for communicating with patients who do not speak English. What is the weather like in Saudi Arabia? Saudi Arabia is a desert country with, believe it or not, a wide range of temperatures. Riyadh, which is in the centre of the Kingdom and set in the middle of the desert sees the greatest temperature differences with an average low of 8C-21C (46F-70F) in the winter and an average high of 42C (108F) in the summer. Jeddah is slightly cooler than Riyadh but also more humid thanks to its location along the Red Sea. Jeddah sees an average low of 18C-29C (64F-84F) in the winter and an average high of 37C (99F) in the summer. When you leave the city on your camping/hiking/touring adventures, be sure to bring a heavy sweater. The desert can actually get quite chilly at night.

"
Saudi Arabia: Entertainment in The Land of Sand,"In today’s post, I answer another common question that people wonder about my country, Saudi Arabia.

The Law in Saudi Arabia

By government laws, we don’t have any movie theaters, bars or nightclubs in Saudi Arabia. Alcohol is banned throughout the whole country. You’re not allowed to consume it anywhere – even at your own home. Doing so is illegal and it’s completely your own responsibility. That’s when the common Western expat question arises: So what do you guys do for fun? for entertainment? We like to go out clubbing and dancing.

Entertainment in Saudi Arabia

To give you an idea of what we do for fun, we do have chain coffee shops, franchise International restaurants and homegrown cafes and foodie spots. So if we wanted to go out for dinner, we can. It’s just that there is no alcohol served anywhere. If we want to catch up with a friend over coffee at Starbucks, we can too! if we wanted to go to the beach (in my city), we could easily do so. For us, residents of Al Khobar in Saudi Arabia, we can even drive over the causeway to neighboring Bahrain for a movie and dinner night. Yes, we are the lucky ones. We can get to Bahrain within 45 minutes to an hour if the road is clear and there isn’t much traffic. Bahrain has normal cinemas just like everywhere else in the world. However, the movies are highly censored, so you should be prepared to miss out on a lot of scenes. This can be frustrating, especially when the censoring effects you understanding the movie plot!

Gatherings At Home

Another favorite past time for Saudi people is to gather in someone’s house and do different activities together. Of course, the gatherings must be gender segregated. So if you’re a woman, you will be hanging out with women only. The same rule applies to men. The gatherings can be done on a weekly basis. So during weekends, we would go to our family friends’ house for a meal and catching up. The mother would cook food at home, and we would gather around a wonderful spread of tasty homemade food. To be honest, food in Saudi Arabia takes up a major part of our lives. It’s part of our culture to cook homemade meals and host dinner parties. To us, gathering around a meal with friends or family is a significant part of our culture and lifestyle. It creates a warm atmosphere and strengthens the ties between us. It’s not only about the bond, it’s also about the food. I don’t think you can be raised in Saudi Arabia and not become a natural foodie. Because the food is so good and makes up a big part of our lives, we grow up to be foodies and home bodies.

90’s Saudi Arabia

Aside from gathering around freshly prepared homemade meals, we also used to play board games with our friends and family. I’m talking about the ’90s here – the simple days. In those times, technology didn’t play a big part of our lives and we didn’t even have mobile phones! For entertainment, we played cards – UNO being a popular one, Monopoly (we were business-minded even as kids!), Charades, and my all-time favorite – Guess Who. Yes, those were the days. Of course I’ve explained what we girls used to do in our free time. The boys obviously played video games, football, or other types of games. We also occasionally went to the cinema in Aramco compound or just went for a walk in that residential area. We were even able to go Trick or Treating inside the Aramco camp! and as teenagers too! not as kids! I must admit, I was a late bloomer. But so were many of my friends. Those were the nineties. It doesn’t bother me that I took my time to grow up. I’m still in no rush to move on to any other phase of my life. If the right person comes along, then yes. Otherwise, I’m happy just living my life as I wish without any interference or meddling from anyone.

Advantages of Meaningful Connections

There are many advantages to not having so many outdoor entertainment options in a place. One is that you develop deeper and more meaningful connections. Your social circle in Saudi become your community. That way, you can be assured that you always have someone to confide in and who you know you can strongly trust. We all shared similar mindsets, goals and dreams. Well at least to a certain extent. While living in Saudi, your social support network is a vital element in your life. You will always have someone to spend time with and to share memories with. That’s why, there’s always a sense of community. You almost never feel lonely or isolated. You tend to spend most of your time with friends or family. And you rarely go out alone or do activities alone. Even shopping for a new wardrobe is done with a friend or two. Another obvious plus to not having many entertainment options is the ability to save more money. Saving becomes a piece of cake when living in Saudi. Since the sources for spending a lot of money don’t exist in the first place, you find yourself naturally saving more money than you would living somewhere like Dubai for example. As you can see there are endless benefits to not having the conventional entertainment venues as in the Western world. The alternative recreation options offer wide opportunities for personal development, connecting with others and building strong bonds and solid friendships. For an extroverted introvert like me; someone who likes to spend some quiet time in self development and growth , I used to read a lot, play video games and ride my bicycle around the house. The bike riding is another story for another time."
Saudi Arabia — Blog — Anna Round the World,"what are the differences between islamic veils?

Before extensively traveling in the Middle East, I honestly didn’t know much about the different types of Islamic veils; it’s important to provide a little background before getting into the clothing aspect. I truly believe that visiting these countries — no matter what your beliefs are — it’s important to respect a country’s culture.

A hijab is the most common type of Islamic veil that you’ll see to cover the hair and is normally used to describe a headscarf, but a hijab means much more than that — it encompasses one’s behavior, speech, and dress in accordance with Islam. Therefore, when you see me use the term “headscarf” it’s used to describe a non-Muslim woman covering her hair.

You’ll also see women using the “niqab,” or “full-faced veil,” but from my experience as a traveller you will not need to wear it unless you’re visiting mainland Yemen. Chadors are commonly found in Iran, and the only time you’ll have to wear one is visiting the mosques, where they’ll provide one at the entrance. Burqas are only found in Afghanistan and are not required as a tourist.

Now that we’ve gone over the different types of Islamic veils, let’s get into what to wear specifically in each country!"
Shopping in Saudi Arabia - Travelling for Fun,"0 Flares 0 Flares ×

Shopping, one of life’s great menaces. Whether it is for shoes, petrol, watches or for carrots it annoys me. Some take great pleasure in this

exercise but not me. When in Saudi Arabia though, this annoyance nearly drove me round the bend. I worked in Saudi Arabia in Jeddah and Jubail for a year and a half ending in 2012 and the country is, well, interesting! I won’t go into all the problems, oil and abuses that they have, for this post I’ll just stick with the simple task of shopping.

Living there takes a bit of getting used to and with shopping in particular you need to get used to the dreaded ‘Sala’. Firstly though I’ll give you an insight into the scene at shopping malls.

Shopping Malls

As I wasn’t living in a compound like many expats do and taking in their experiences and living in a herd I thought everybody was looking at me all the time. You think because you are white, because you wearing a tracksuit or jeans or you don’t have some sort of facial hair that they are all out to get you. In fact they couldn’t care less and nobody pays any bit of attention. With this in mind I had been in shopping malls several times before I was relaxed enough to actually look around and take in what was happening. Basically shopping malls are the playground of women. I don’t have any stats for you but I’m fairly sure that there are at least twice as many shopping malls in a Saudi city than in the western world. They are everywhere and are also very similar to what you are used to, fancy clothes shops, book shops, food, coffee, electronics etc etc. No real difference. Every shopping mall is packed with women and their children in the evening time. This is because women cannot work for the most part so the only excursion they get is to the mall. They look like moving black chess pawns and with a majority you can only see their eyes and their shoes. The same as the stereotype I It’s like a big game of one sided chess with little children in between. The face covering though is a personal choice by the woman so her face does not have to be covered by a niqab if she doesn’t want to despite what some media might tell you. Having said that after a few months of no women your imagination gets a lot more active! You see this covered woman who you think must be in her twenties by her eyes and the fancy way she has the make-up on (only around the eyes, God forbid you should see her face or arms)and then she has very fancy high heels on below this and you start to wonder if she is good looking or not. Let me tell you after a few months in Saudi Arabia you start to think that nearly every woman in the shopping mall is good looking!

The dreaded Sala

I digress, the most annoying part of every expats shopping experience is ‘Sala’. The dreaded Sala. Sala is the Arabic word for prayer and what the everybody calls prayer time. One of the 5 pillars of Islam is prayer and each Muslim should pray 5 times per day. These are spread out over the day but 3 are in the afternoon/evening time. Saudi though is different from other Islamic countries because shops close when Sala is on. As soon as you hear the wailing from the mosque to signal the start of prayer time, the doors are locked and people can’t get in or out. The Sala lasts around 25-30min which is a long time to be stuck in a shop. Other Islamic countries have the same prayer time but the shops stay open. You can go and pray if you want, no forcing involved.

In my experience, one thing a non-Muslim in Saudi Arabia should have is Muslim-Pro! An invaluable piece of kit. This is a smart phone app and tells you the prayer times each day. I have no association with the app and there must be a hundred other apps that do the same thing so if you want to keep your shopping short in Saudi then get one! Prayer time depends on the sun and so every day it changes slightly, so just when you think you know when it is, a week later its completely different. I’m sure it was meant for devout Muslims and that the makers didn’t think of it but it saved me eons of time!

Several times, before I got the app, I was doing my weekly shopping in a supermarket and would be the next person in the queue at the checkout and the clerk would just go off for a half hour pray. 20min of this was just talking with his friends in the coffee shop while I stand like a lemon waiting for him to return. It is infuriating when a 20minute excursion turns into an hour. On the street a lot of the normal shops close down their shutters and the Indians that are running them just sit outside for half an hour and chat until the wailing signals the end. Very bizarre at first glance but after a while it become second nature. Even writing about it now, what seemed normal then it still a bit strange.

Now you may think that this is intolerance on my part because I am not a Muslim but I wasn’t the only one frustrated. Plenty of locals after 20minutes start giving out to the clerks in the shops about why they don’t open, at petrol (gas) pumps people sitting in their cars start beeping continuously for minutes until the attendants come back. It is some racket. It is Sharia (Islamic) law that says they should close and religious police enforce this so if you are caught with your shop opening during Sala you could be shut down or a worse personal fate. And in Saudi you don’t want anything to do with the police of any kind.

So if you ever find yourself shopping in Saudi Arabia then beware!"

Pushing the boundaries of entertainment design in KSA,"Entertainment is all about the experience and through design you can never forget that. It is so emotive and personal, and understanding the experience is one of the challenges in KSA but it is also a great creative opportunity to be inventive.



As I mentioned before, it was only since 2018 that we have seen cinemas and the Seasons which really opened the door for what experiences can look like and what the market really wanted. The key is understanding that what works elsewhere in the world does not necessarily translate across to here without needing to be tested for relevance and ensuring it is applicable to social expectations and other factors.



That is where the entertainment developers are making absolute strides in articulating a KSA vision. The blend of world-leading entertainment executives and expertise, that have delivered projects across the globe, coupled with the skill and ambition of the local market is really developing schemes that just work here.



Where ambition is a facilitator, it can also cause challenges with the sheer volume of to market projects and shortages that might come with it.



The challenge of supply and demand or skills shortages is not unique to the entertainment sector in KSA, however they do pose very specific challenges. Since the sector itself is so unique and everything is taking place in the Kingdom for the first time, it is not just a matter of replicating what we’ve seen elsewhere. This sector is evolving so rapidly. Take for example event spaces, arenas, theme parks, water parks and virtual reality (VR) experiences – they are all very specific and happening in huge volumes.



This can cause shortages in creatives, specialists and contractors with the required abilities. An example here is looking at something very specialist such as the theming contractors which require very skilled fabrication and installation.



Another real roadblock is the potential shortages that arise with mass production and delivery, which drives up costs.



But ultimately, the collaboration between global and local experts offers unique perspectives for resolving challenges and means we are able to look at things differently – particularly when considering the impact in the design, standardisation etc. At Cundall, we have experienced complete innovation in the procurement and fabrication space, whereby developers and clients set up hybrid models and create their own fabrication streams.



I believe that the key to tackling all of the nuances and complexities is careful consideration, from the project intent through to the build, and realising that we are all going to be stretched thin, so we must look at how we can tackle things together. True collaboration is what we are seeing and that allows us to view challenges differently."

Singapore opposition hit with misinformation law before polls,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s government has used a controversial online misinformation law to order an opposition party to correct a social media post, days after campaigning got underway for an election next week.

Under the law, ministers can order social media sites to put warnings next to posts the government considers false and order pages be blocked, but critics fear it is being used to suppress dissent.

On Thursday the government ordered Peoples Voice to correct a video posted on Facebook and YouTube and the opposition party complied, putting up banners saying it contains inaccurate information.

In the video, party chief Lim Tean said the government spends a quarter of a billion Singapore dollars ($180 million) “providing free education for foreigners every year.”

A government website aimed at debunking untrue information said the video contained “a false and misleading statement,” as a significant majority of such students have to pay fees higher than local students.

The large number of foreigners in the city-state has become a hot-button issue ahead of the election, with the opposition pressing the government to put Singaporeans first when it comes to job opportunities.

People’s Voice is among a handful of small opposition groups taking on the long-ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) at the July 10 vote.

While the PAP is expected to remain in power, the opposition hopes to win more seats in parliament.

Since the misinformation law came into force last year, several opposition figures and activists have been ordered to correct posts while Facebook has been forced to block pages on several occasions.

The tech giant said last month the use of the law is “severe” and risks stifling free speech, while Google and Twitter have also expressed concerns.

But authorities insist the measure is necessary to stop falsehoods from circulating online that could sow divisions in the multi-ethnic, multi-faith country of 5.7 million."
"Blast in eastern Afghanistan kills top Pakistani militant, Afghan officials say","KABUL/PESHAWAR: A top Pakistani militant, Mangal Bagh, was killed in an explosion in Afghanistan’s eastern Nangarhar province on Thursday, Afghan officials said.

Bagh, 47, was one of the founders of Lashkar-e-Islam, a group that for over a decade remained involved in militant attacks and drug trafficking in Khyber district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan.

For a short period, he was also affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban.

""The leader of Lashkar-e-Islam terrorist group, Mangal Bagh along with his two friends were killed in a mine placed from their side in Achin district ... today before lunch,"" Nangarhar governor Ziaulhaq Amarkhail said in a tweet.

""Mangal Bagh was involved in a series of terroristic activities in the region,"" he added.

Another official from the province told Arab News on condition of anonymity that the landmine that killed Bagh and his associates in Achin district of Nangarhar, where they were hiding, was planted by the militants themselves to prevent capture by security forces.

""They were walking when they run over the mine which they had placed for their own protection in order to block attack for their capture,"" he said.

The source also said that Bagh had been involved in sectarian killings in the Khyber area and his fighters had also attacked convoys carrying US supplies in the past years.

The US in 2018 placed a bounty of $5 million on Bagh’s head.

Malik Riaz Bangash, a Pakistani security analyst based in Peshawar, told Arab News that Bagh's death would be a setback for his criminal outfit and a big news for Pakistan.

""Mangal Bagh death, if confirmed, will be a big news for many because he had his role in different terror activities, including the Army Public School (APS) attack,"" Bangash said.

""I don't think the terror group will be able to find his replacement amongst its cadres because he was the only person known for his terror tactics."""
Game of thrones: Moscow ‘aiding Taliban to undermine US role’,"KABUL: Russia has aided the Taliban for years to force a US withdrawal from Kabul and undermine American influence in the war-ravaged country, a governor and several former Afghan officials told Arab News on Saturday.

Rahmatullah Nabil, director of Afghanistan’s intelligence until 2015, said: “Moscow initiated contact with the Taliban through Iran before 2014, just as Daesh emerged in Afghanistan. Russia believed that the Taliban, unlike Daesh, only had a local agenda and no external ambition.”

He added that Russian engagement with the Taliban began with a “covert meeting in a central Asian country in 2014/2015.”

Nabil’s claims follow news reports last week that allege Moscow offered bounties to the Taliban for the killing of US soldiers in Afghanistan.

The reports, based on US intelligence, were established from intercepted electronic data which showed financial transactions between Russia’s military intelligence agency and a Taliban-linked account. US officials have also named an Afghan contractor who acted as a key middleman in the relationship.

Afghanistan is seen as an important area of Russian foreign policy. Moscow has long regarded Kabul as a key part of its sphere of influence in Central Asia.

Nabil said Russia built ties with the Taliban by investing in key areas and supplying weapons.

“Russia invested in four layers in Afghanistan — high-ranking government officials, politicians, Taliban and local warlords in the north. To the first two categories, it sent financial support through Hawala (a traditional tool for money transfers) through some Afghan businessmen, and a top-up in fuel which was exported to Afghanistan,” he said.

He added that weapons “were given at some borders and crossing points.”

“In 2016, Moscow also handed over 10,000 AK-47s to government forces. Even the government does not know where the rifles are,” he said.

Moscow welcomed the toppling of the Taliban in the 2001 US-led invasion, but over the years it has — like its regional ally Iran — spoken against an extended US presence in the country.

Experts say Russia’s complaints have been long in the making.

It began with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, with Russia accusing the US and other Western countries of supplying weapons to Mujahideen factions who fought against Soviet troops.

Russia was eventually forced to retreat from Kabul after nearly 10 years of bloody occupation, creating a deep mistrust between Moscow and Washington, which eventually lead to Russia aiding the Taliban in its bid to force a US withdrawal.

Ghulam Rabbani Rabbani, a member of Kunduz’s provincial council, said he was “not surprised” to learn that Russia was using the Taliban. He added that Rahmatullah Azizi, an Afghan businessman, had acted as a middleman between the two groups.

“Azizi has disappeared all of a sudden, but the intelligence agency has arrested four people close to him,” Rabbani told Arab News.

Others said the war in Afghanistan had both “regional and international dimensions,” and that Russia was just one of the players in the “great game.”

“The war here is not between the government and the Taliban, otherwise you would have already seen a winner,” Dawlat Waziri, a retired defense ministry general, told Arab News, adding that Moscow was tending to old wounds.

“Russia wants the US to suffer a defeat like it did. It wants America to lose soldiers and see the downfall of its economy so that it is forced to leave Afghanistan,” he said.

Anwar Jigdalak, a former governor of Kunduz province, agreed.

Citing locals in northern Kunduz, 335 km north of Kabul, he said the Taliban had once sent one of its shadow governors, Mawlavi Abdul Salaam, to Tajikistan to hold talks with Russian officials and strengthen their relationship.

Kunduz is a strategic province which lies close to Tajikistan, and was the first city seized by the Taliban in 2015 “with the help of Russian intelligence,” Jigdalak said.

“But when Salaam returned to Afghanistan, an American killed him in an air strike. When Moscow wants to be present in Syria, which is very far, why not have influence in Afghanistan which is close,” he added, referring in part to the Russian support of Syria’s Assad regime.

Experts say other issues are at stake, too.

Aimal Faizi, an analyst, said the allegations of Russian bounties are “part of an effort by some to keep troops in Afghanistan.”

He tweeted: “They have been trying to prolong the US war and occupation in Afghanistan by different means.”

Both Moscow and the Taliban have repeatedly denied the allegations. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told Arab News on Thursday that the reports were “false,” and spread “to keep US troops in Afghanistan to confront its enemies.”

He added: “Our contacts with Russia have been all the time for political and diplomatic goals only.”

Last week’s report comes amid a push by several current and former US generals to keep US troops in Afghanistan, an important condition for a historic peace deal signed with the Taliban in late February this year.

If it happens, it could throw the spotlight on President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to withdraw all troops from the country.

Trump, who is standing for re-election in November, said all soldiers would leave by next spring based on the February agreement."

When the UK turned the heat on China with its surprise announcement that it was ending Huawei’s involvement in Britain’s 5G network infrastructure, followed by a suspension of Britain’s extradition treaty with Hong Kong, it was clear that these actions had as much to do with London’s relations with Washington as with Beijing.

There may be good reasons to confront, or at least be cautious about, China’s intentions in its drive to become a leader in the 5G world, and critical of the methods it is applying to achieve this; and there are most definitely legitimate concerns about China’s human rights record and its abysmal behaviour toward the people of Hong Kong in violation of the 1984 Sino–British Joint Declaration that set the terms of British withdrawal from the colony and its return to China in 1997.

Nevertheless, the timing of Britain’s actions, under American duress, raises concerns that this is bringing the world a step closer to a new Cold War, in which the UK is not necessarily asserting its own position and interests, let alone values, but is being dragged into for fear of the Trump administration’s Sinophobic rage and to guard transatlantic relations. Its pursuit of the Brexit folly has exposed the UK’s vulnerability to US pressure and to Chinese retaliatory measures.

According to the Observer newspaper, the UK government privately admitted to Huawei’s representatives that it was ending their company’s involvement in Britain’s 5G network not only because of genuine security concerns, but to a large extent for “geopolitical” reasons, or in other words, massive pressure by President Trump. To increase that pressure, a delegation of senior White House officials flew to London to present the government with allegedly fresh technical evidence to back their claims of security risks posed by Huawei and to demand a full British 5G ban on Huawei.

What gives credibility to assertions of American pressure rather than any reassessment of the risk of Huawei conducting wholesale surveillance in the UK is that as recently as late January the government decided to allow Huawei’s involvement in the super-fast 5G network, with certain exclusions and limitations regarding core functions, as was recommended by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre.

The importance of cyber security in an age when so much activity is conducted in and depends on cyberspace is in no doubt, as is ensuring that all sensitive information regarding national security and the private lives of individuals is guarded. But the commercial world as well as governments have long been hacking into each other’s networks and invading the privacy of internet users, and China is far from being the only culprit.

It is the timing, the haste and the sudden change of heart that makes one skeptical about the motives of the British government and its readiness to risk the wrath of Beijing, which will probably come in the form of punitive economic measures. After all, the UK is aligning itself late with the other Five Eyes intelligence-sharing nations in banning Huawei from its 5G network.

The timing of Britain’s actions against China, under American duress, raises concerns that this is bringing the world a step closer to a new Cold War. Yossi Mekelberg

Equally, the current phase of Beijing’s attack on Hong Kong’s “one country two systems” agreement began more than a year ago, when a bill was introduced in June 2019 allowing extradition to mainland China. Beijing’s response to the protests against the bill left no doubt that this was another step toward abolishing any exceptionalism for the former British colony and curtailing the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong while using excessive force against protesters and locking up their leaders. But neither the UK nor the US did much to support the rights of the people of Hong Kong until it suited their wider interest of confronting China.

On both counts Boris Johnson’s government could have developed its own specific and targeted policies while distancing itself from Trump’s all-out confrontation with China, which is more about the president’s biases, prejudices and nationalist populism that threaten to drag the US, its allies and the rest of world into a new Cold War in which there are unlikely to be any winners.

Unlike the previous Cold War with its deep ideological undercurrents and nuclear cloud hanging above it, the present one is becoming an aggressive contest with no clear objectives, fueled by bellicose demagoguery originating from the Trump administration’s inclination to blame China for all the world’s ills, including the coronavirus pandemic, described by the US president as the “Chinese virus” while propagating the “theory” that it was started in a Chinese laboratory, despite his own intelligence agencies not supporting this accusation. In the Trump mindset, at a time when almost everything is going horribly wrong for him and with less than four months before the presidential elections, aggravating relations with China is his wild card aimed at rallying the nationalist base and creating a false sense of him as a world leader containing China’s hegemonic aspirations, while leaning on allies to pursue similar policies.

Instead of employing a mix of assertiveness, pragmatism and caution, the US is leading the march, now with the support of the UK, toward a full-on clash with Beijing, while being inconsistent on both trade and human rights issues. Both countries should ask themselves why they haven’t built the capacity to preclude any reliance on Huawei to construct their 5G networks, and by such neglect exposed their technological vulnerability and inability to advance their democratic values.

China’s treatment of Hong Kong, Tibet or the Uighur people deserves condemnation and a powerful response, and protecting intellectual property and network security are issues of national interest. But what we are witnessing right now is an escalation of hostilities with a resurgent and confident China, rather than any principled position on human rights, or pragmatic one on trade relations being taken. It is a lose-lose scenario which is likely to serve only Trump’s electioneering needs, and in which the UK is proving itself to be no more than a weak tag-along.

Suspected Boko Haram extremists kill at least 40 farmers in Nigeria,"MAIDGURI, Nigeria: Suspected members of the militant group Boko Haram killed at least 40 rice farmers and fishermen while they were harvesting crops in Nigeria’s northern Borno State, officials said.

The attack was staged Saturday in a rice field in Garin Kwashebe, a Borno community known for rice farming, on the day residents of the state were casting votes for the first time in 13 years to elect local government councils, though many didn’t go to cast their ballots.

The farmers were reportedly rounded up and summarily killed by armed insurgents.

Malam Zabarmari, a leader of a rice farmers association in Borno state, confirmed the massacre.

“The farmers were attacked at the Garin-Kwashebe rice field in Zabarmari community, and according to reports reaching us since afternoon, about 40 of them were killed,” he said, adding that it likely could be up to 60 people killed.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari expressed grief over the killings.

“I condemn the killing of our hardworking farmers by terrorists in Borno State. The entire country is hurt by these senseless killings. My thoughts are with their families in this time of grief. May their souls Rest In Peace,” he said in a statement.

Buhari said the government had given all the needed support to the armed forces “to take all necessary steps to protect the country’s population and its territory.”

A member of the House of Representatives, Ahmed Satomi, who represents the Jere Federal constituency of Borno, said at least 44 burials will take place Sunday.

“Farmers and fishermen were killed in cold blood. Over 60 farmers were affected, but we only have so far received 44 corpses from the farms and we are preparing for their burials today, Sunday by God’s grace,” the federal lawmaker said.

Boko Haram and a breakaway faction, the Islamic State West Africa Province, are both active in the region. Boko Haram’s more than decade-long insurgency has left thousands dead and displaced tens of thousands. Officials say Boko Haram members often force villagers to pay illegal taxes by taking their livestock or crops. But over time, some villagers have begun to resist the extortion.

Satomi said the farmers in Garin Kwashebe were attacked because they had disarmed and arrested a Boko Haram gunman on Friday who had been tormenting them.

“A lone gunman, who was a member of Boko Haram came to harass the farmers by ordering them to give him money and also cook for him. While he was waiting for the food to be cooked, the farmers seized the moment he stepped into the toilet to snatch his rifle and tied him up,” he said.

“They later handed him over to the security. But sadly, the security forces did not protect the courageous farmer. And in reprisal for daring them, the Boko Haram mobilized and came to attack them on their farms.”

Insurgents also torched the rice farms before leaving, he said."
TWITTER POLL: Two-thirds say they won’t volunteer for COVID-19 vaccine,"DUBAI: Nearly two-thirds of respondents to an Arab News Twitter poll said they would not be willing to take part in a coronavirus vaccine trial.

Of the 949 people who took part nearly 61 percent said they would not be willing to join a vaccine trial, while nearly 40 percent said they would.

Laboratories around the world are in a race to be the first to discover a formula that will cure the virus that has claimed up to 880,000 lives, while infecting millions more.

The discovery of a cure, or vaccine to protect us from the virus, would likely be worth millions to the country and company that creates it.

But many people are wary to take part in such trials as part of the process often involves being infected with the disease that is being researched."
Passenger flights reduced by more than half in Arab region,"Passenger flights dropped by more than 50 percent in the first half of 2020 across the Arab region compared to 2019, a UN economy report found.

The closure of land borders - due to the COVID-19 global pandemic – has widely restricted the movement of people and goods.

Maritime transfer of good, however, has remained fairly consistent despite disruptions, a report by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) titled ‘Impact of COVID-19 on Transport in the Arab Region’ found.

Revenue losses of airline companies in the region are estimated at $38 billion this year, which is only 53 percent of 2019’s revenue, the report said, adding that global air travel is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels before 2023.

ESCWA Executive Secretary Rola Dashti urged Arab Governments to implement support measures for the transport and logistics sector, including financial support, tax rebates, other duties exemptions, and subsiding workers' salaries and training.

“Governments should strengthen international and regional cooperation to take concerted actions to address the pandemic and its impact on transport and logistics, such as information sharing, mutual recognition of certificates and compliance documents, and border management coordination,” Dashti said.

Alexanda Kotey, left, and El-Shafee El-Sheikh were captured by Kurdish forces in Syria in 2018 and handed over to the US military. (Reuters)

The case of El-Shafee El-Sheikh was back in the news this week. He is one of the most notorious terrorists produced by the West in recent decades, although many will not be familiar with his name.

Together with Mohammed Emwazi, Alexanda Kotey and Aine Davis, he was allegedly one of four British extremists fighting for Daesh, collectively known as “The Beatles,” who were assigned to guard foreign hostages. Their notoriety comes from the fact that they are believed to have murdered, on camera, at least 29 people, including two Americans, two Britons, two Japanese and 22 Syrians.

El-Sheikh does not deny being a member of Daesh, although he denies the allegations of murder and torture. He and Kotey were captured by Kurdish forces in Syria in 2018 and handed over to the US. They remain in military custody in Iraq.

This week, El-Sheikh’s mother lost a final legal battle in her efforts to prevent British intelligence services from handing over evidence they gathered against El-Sheikh and Kotey to US authorities ahead of a trial.

In the absence of that evidence, the US was threatening to transfer the pair into Iraqi custody, where they would likely face a rapid trial and possible execution.

El-Sheikh’s mother also lost a case before the English High Court last year during which it was argued that the transfer of evidence to authorities in the US breached data protection rights. She appealed to the Supreme Court, and won on the grounds that her son might face the death penalty. Since then, however, the US government has given assurances that it will not seek the death penalty in the case, which is why the latest court ruling cleared the way for the evidence to be handed over.

There is another aspect to this case. Just as in the cases of Shamima Begum and a number of other Britons who traveled to join Daesh, El-Sheikh and Kotey were stripped of their British citizenship. “Not our problem,” was the attitude of the British government. It was, in effect, throwing its own dirty laundry into a neighbor’s garden.

The UK is not alone in doing this; other European states have done the same. Flushed with relief that these men and women left their own country to wreak carnage in someone else’s, European governments acted to make sure they could not come back.

These kinds of policies are popular but that does not make them right. There are two principles at stake: Justice and fairness. Neither of these principles apply directly to the extremists themselves. Although many who have been interviewed since capture express regret and remorse for their actions, they have no grounds to complain about the consequences that they face, however hard they may be. But the principles of justice and fairness apply more widely.

Justice is the demand of civilized society as a whole that there should be clearly defined consequences for wrongdoing, applied as consistently as possible and in which there is accountability for one’s actions. It is justice that demands a fair trial during which the defendant can present their best defense, and in which their guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is justice that reassures victims and their families that however random a crime, there is still a sovereign authority that is capable of imposing order.

The principle of fairness demands that countries should take responsibility for their own citizens. When a country grants citizenship, whether through birth or long-term residence, it is not only giving an individual a passport and a collection of rights and duties. It is also making a statement to the world: “This person is now one of ours. We are responsible for them.”

When countries do not take the process of granting citizenship seriously, they are left with obligations they regret. But it should not be possible simply to disown those obligations.

The US is not innocent of this sort of behavior, either. But it does take the principle of citizenship more seriously than most European states. In February 2019, President Donald Trump tweeted about his disappointment that European countries were refusing to take back their extremists.

In the case of El-Sheikh and Kotey, the US has an interest in prosecuting them because their alleged crimes involved US citizens. However, the Americans cannot prosecute every Daesh fighter they capture, and nor should they.

Trump’s way of making his points on Twitter, without couching them in diplomatic language, is not popular in Europe. But, as with his grumbles about contributions to NATO, his complaint that European countries are not pulling their weight in the pursuit of global security is not without merit.

It is right that criminals should face justice in the country where they commit their crimes. But the Iraqi judicial system has clearly been overwhelmed by the number of cases it is processing. Peter Welby

There are two alternatives to the US prosecuting European extremists in its custody: Hand them over to local law enforcement in the countries where they were captured, or release them.

If Iraqi or Syrian law enforcement had the capacity or the will to provide fair, open and thorough trials for the hundreds of European extremists in custody, this might be the most appropriate option. It is right that criminals should face justice in the country where they commit their crimes. But the Iraqi judicial system has clearly been overwhelmed by the number of cases it is processing.

Releasing the prisoners, on the other hand, would exacerbate the security situation in the region and pose threats to their countries of origin as well. There is a simple solution to this dilemma: European states should make arrangements, introducing new laws if necessary, to bring the extremists home to face their nation’s justice.
