Saudi Arabia tourism FAQ — Young Pioneer Tours,"Everything you wanted to know from the first tourists in Saudi Arabia

For a very long time, non-religious-related tourism just wasn’t a thing in Saudi Arabia. But then, suddenly, it opened up. In order to save the day with a cancelled tour to Iraq, YPT did what we’re best at – adaptability – and ended up leading one of the first tourist groups on the new e-visa scheme to Saudi Arabia. Here are the most important answers to what is on your mind if you are considering visiting the fascinating Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

How easy is that new visa policy?

The answer is: very! You apply on the website, you get your visa within minutes and you are then allowed to book the next flight to Saudi Arabia. It can be done in a day.

On arrival at the airport, your fingerprints and photo will be taken and you will receive a neat stamp in your passport. That’s it, you’re in! You don’t need to be supervised to go around Saudi Arabia, whether you are male or female. Which brings us to our next point.

Do women need to cover themselves when in Saudi ?

Saudi Arabia is known around the world for its conservative take on Islam and the ladies here will often wear the full burka, leaving a tiny slit for their eyes, when they go in public.

For tourists, however, the only requirement is to dress modestly. According to the Saudi visa website’s, this means avoiding tight-fitting clothes and showing legs or cleavage. It is not necessary for foreign women to cover their hair and 3/4 pants are ok. Controversial messages on shirt are also to be avoided.

How easy is it to get around in Saudi Arabia?

At the moment, not very. Riyadh, the capital, is building its first subway system, but it was incomplete at time of writing. There are no buses in the cities, which means that public transportation is non-existent. Solo travelers will have to use taxis or rent a car, which makes expeditions outside of the cities quite costly. Uber – and the Gulf version of Uber, Careem – are, however, well implemented.

Saudi Arabia is quite a large country which means that, if you want to cover a larger territory and do not have so much time, you’ll have to rely on Saudis’ domestic flights. Saudi Arabia is currently building a very nice and brand-new rail network, but it’s only partially completed.

What to know when planning a trip to Saudi Arabia?

When planning your schedule, take into account the laws and customs of Saudi Arabia, which might be very different from what you are used to. For example, all shops, museums and so on will close for 20 to 30 minutes throughout the day during the call to prayer. During the day, between noon and 4 PM, most shops are also closed due to the fact that it simply gets too hot out. On the other hand, life in Saudi goes on until quite late at night, and it is not rare for people to have dinner around 9 or 10 PM, which means that restaurants are open until quite late.

Can you drink alcohol in Saudi Arabia?

No, at the moment, it is not possible to bring alcohol in Saudi Arabia and the consumption of alcohol anywhere in the country, for anyone, is illegal.

However, the rumour is that a Saudi tobacco/e-cigarette magnate has announced that he has acquired a license for alcohol, so, as with many other things, this might be about to change.

Can you visit Mecca or Medina as a tourist?

No. The new tourist visa to Saudi Arabia does not allow travel to these cities, and passports as well as visas are checked before entering those zones. It is necessary to come with an Umrah or Hajj visa to see these places, which requires being Muslim.

Can you enter overland using the tourist e-visa?

The big question! Many people would like to enter the country through Bahrain or the Emirates, for example. At the time of writing, it is simply not written anywhere if this is allowed. The rumour is that you need to first enter by flight so that your fingerprints are recorded on the database, and that following this you can enter the country any way you want. We’ll be waiting for confirmation of that and updating this article as soon as somebody has tried!

The best way to make the most of this fascinating country that has just opened up is to visit it with YPT; join us on our Saudi Arabia Tour!

The service tax does not go to the waiter. For a small favor, like carrying luggage or parking a car, a few Saudi riyals would be appropriate. Not more than five. Often times in Saudi Arabia you will find someone tending to the bathroom to keep it clean. Giving them one Saudi riyal is an appropriate amount.

– Tipping your tour guide and vehicle driver is completely optional but should be considered if you’re provided with great service. If you decide to tip feel free to give what you think your experience was worth.

FAQ,
The Best Things To Know Before Visiting Saudi Arabia,"Have you seen the news that visiting Saudi Arabia is now a possibility for many people in the western world? It is true, the kingdom is now opening its doors to tourism which means a lot more people are planning a trip to Saudi Arabia than ever before. My son and I were lucky enough to travel to Saudi Arabia for the first time just after the country reopened post pandemic closures. We share all that we learned along the way as planning a trip to Saudi Arabia can be a bit overwhelming since it’s been closed to the outside world for so long and there isn’t a ton of information out there.

Obtaining a Visa for Visiting Saudi Arabia

First things first – you need a way to get into the country. The thing that opened the doors for tourism in Saudi was the introduction of the Saudi e-visa. The issuance of an e-visa can now be approved online in minutes. This has opened the door to visitors from all over the world. Entry visit visas cost SAR535 ($142) per person and are valid for one year (multiple entry) with each stay no more than 90 days. The Saudi tourist visa also includes health insurance during your visit. It might be a good idea to also get travel insurance to cover all other aspects of your visit.

The eVisa (or on arrival) are available for citizens of 49 countries including the United States, UK, Canada and most European countries. Check the link above to see if your country is on the list. If you plan to conduct any work in the country you will still need to go through proper channels to obtain a business visa. Saudi tourism authority is hard at work to lure more and more western tourists to the country.

The Best Time to Travel to Saudi Arabia

As Saudi Arabia is located in the middle of a vast desert, you can imagine that the summer months will be scorching hot, however plenty of people still do visit during those months. That said, the best time of year to travel to Saudi Arabia is in the winter months from around November through April.

Be aware though that even though it can be quite warm during the day, the early morning and evening hours can be quite cold, especially if you are out in the desert going on an adventure, so don’t forget your light jacket.

Also take note of the dates of Ramadan that occurs for a month every year. In 2023, Ramadan will be celebrated from the evening of Wednesday 22 March to the end the evening of Friday 21 April, with Eid ul-Fitr celebrated on Saturday 22 April. During this time many restaurants might be closed until after sunset and it is highly recommend to not eat or drink while in public spaces. That said, I did visit Iraq during Ramadan and found it to be a good time to go as we were able to see so much more of the local culture.

What to Wear

One of the biggest inquiries on visiting Saudi Arabia is what is the dress code – especially if you are a female tourist. Having visited many conservative countries in the Middle East and throughout the world, I will say that Saudi Arabia didn’t feel that different than other destinations in the world. Guidelines regarding women’s attire have relaxed in recent years, but there are still quite few norms to obverse.

Women, local or tourist, are no longer required to wear an abaya (the long flowy black dress) over their clothes, however you will see that the majority of local women do still wear them as it is the expected norm. Often times the Saudi women will have their open abaya when out and about, but close them up when around family or friends. The hijab (head covering) is not required for local or foreign women. I wore an abaya and hijab one one day, but did not the other days of my visit and did not notice any difference in how I was treated or being observed.

As with all conservative countries I do however recommend wearing modest clothing covering knees and shoulders as a show of respect to the local culture. For me, this included long skirts (down to my ankles), leggings with a dress over top, long sleeves and no low cut tops. Ideally it is a good idea to wear loose fitting clothing that is flowy, which will be best for the weather and for the local culture.

Short dress, sleeveless shirts, shorts, crop tops and the like are not allowed. Additionally, you will find that on public beaches it may not be accepted to wear a bikini swimsuit.

Other Frequently Asked Questions About Visiting Saudi Arabia

Below we share a lot of the questions we got asked after our return from Saudi and will continue to update this section as we get asked more!

Can You Drink in Saudi Arabia?

Alcohol is still strictly forbidden in Saudi Arabia. You will not find it in any restaurants or hotels. It is also illegal to bring it in yourself. That does not mean locals do not drink, but I would highly suggest staying away from it even if you find yourself in the company of locals who do have access. Better to be on the right side of the Saudi officials and the local laws in a newly opened country.

Cash or Credit Card?

For the most part, most places take credit card, however at the smaller market shops cash is usually expected. I will note that more than once we were given a discount even without being asked, even using our credit cards. It felt very safe and we had no issues with our cards from the United States.

Prayer Times

One of the things I love most about travel in a Muslim country is the call to prayer. Yes, this happens several times a day, often very early in the morning as well. We loved hearing the call and were not bothered by it, but if you are a light sleeper you might consider bringing ear plugs or a sound machine.

Rental Car or Public Transportation?

During our visit we had a car and driver which was amazing. However if I were to travel to the kingdom again, I would try to take buses between destinations when possible and then hire a car if I wasn’t doing a local tour. I will say that you can do a lot on your own as the roads are nice and well signposted, but to get the most out of the experience I would highly suggest a local guide.

Does Saudi Feel Safe?

Yes! I always felt so safe in Saudi everywhere we went. Even being a solo female traveling on my own with my son, I never felt like we were in the wrong place or that we should worry about our personal safety. I am sure there is petty crime like any place in the world, but overall we felt very safe and secure here.

Note that often times there are strict security measures when entering malls, festival grounds or public places where lots of people congregate. There are often seperate entrances for men and women to have their belongings searched. Also, it was often the case that we were told we could not bring in our big cameras.

Can Unmarried Man and Woman Share a Hotel Room?

I did not experience this personally, but I have read that it is now possible for unmarried men and women foreign tourists, but not Saudi citizens, to share hotel rooms. In the past this was not the case, but as things are opening up more and more I expect this will continue. I would not be surprised that smaller towns or small family run hotels might still raise an eyebrow or two. Be aware that it is still not acceptable to show public displays of affection.

Is it Ethical to Visit Saudi Arabia?

This is one for each person to decide on their own. Even though there might be questions about the human rights record for the Saudi Arabia ministry and/or Mohamed bin Salman, it is a fascinating country well worth your time and energy. I also feel personally that the Saudi government is moving in the correct direction. For me personally, if I didn’t visit places that had questionable government practices I probably wouldn’t be able to go anywhere even in my home country! The tourism sector here is still new and growing and with that I think more will change over time as well. Do note that Islamic Law is still followed, so do adhere to all local laws.

Where to Go in Saudi Arabia

The main destinations that tourists are visiting in Saudi Arabia right now include the capital Riyadh, the port city of Jeddah, the desert oasis town of AlUla and the mountain villages of Jizan. However, just these 4 destinations alone comprise more than 3500 km. This country is large and will take some time to get around if you want to see much. You can also expect to fly at least once between your destinations. There is a budget airline called flyadeal which if you book in advance can offer good rates between major cities.

Riyadh

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Karilyn | Adventure Travel (@nobackhome)

The capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is Riyadh. It is here that most international flights will arrive and as such it makes sense to begin and end your journey here. Having visited many Middle Eastern countries, I will say that Riyadh has its own feel. It isn’t like nearby neighbors in the United Arab Emirates with fancy shopping malls and sports cars jipping around the city, but also not quite like other countries in the area. It is a city filled with culture and history, has all the modern conveniences you will need, but also just outside of the city you can find yourself dune bashing up massive sand dunes.

Our top picks for Riyadh include Masmak Fort in the Old City, Red Sand Dunes and Ad Diriyah outside of the city and sunset at the Skybridge Tower for a view over town.

Jeddah

During our visit we didn’t have time to get to Jeddah, but it is high on our list as it looks so fun and we have heard it’s the more progressive of the major cities in Saudi Arabia. Formed in the 7th century AD for Muslims going to Mecca who are arriving by sea. From what we heard from locals, Jeddah is where you will find the hipsters in Saudi in the many local cafes opening up more and more. Top things to do in Jeddah include visiting the Al Balad, area which is home to a UNESCO World Heritage site and most expats in the city. As Jeddah is located on the shores of the Red Sea you must make a visit here where you will even see women wearing bikinis! While in town, also check out Al Wahba Crater which is believed to be caused by a meteorite. And finally, the Floating Mosque which is on the sea.

Al-Ula

Al Ula is one already one of the most famous touristic destinations in Saudi Arabia and for good reason. This desert oasis has centuries old heritage sites, opportunities to venture far into the desert for its natural beauty and stunning eco friendly hotels. One of the biggest draws for visitors here is Hegra or Madinah Saleh which was an ancient city founded by local tribes over 5000 years ago. The Romans conquered Hegra (and Petra in Jordan) but more than 100 tombs made out of the desert rocks still remain. It is an interesting site as it is virtually empty, but still as fascinating at Petra in Jordan!

In addition to Hegra, you can get out into the desert in search of beautiful rock structures for all your IG photo needs, you can visit Al Deerah Heritage Village (the Old Town) to see the 2000 year old mud based ghost town that is left. There are amazing restaurants, cafes build into the sand and some of the only tourist type shopping we saw in the country. I could easily spend more than a few days here soaking up everything around as well as checking out the super cool desert glamping options that have cropped up since our last visit.

Jizan

If you are looking to get off the beaten path a bit, then Jizan is where you should head. The dramatic mountains and Yemeni-like culture is totally different from any other place you might be visiting in Saudi Arabia. It is well worth the effort to get here to really explore the Yemeni culture in Saudi.

The places to visit in this area are Fayfa and Absiyah, two mountain villages where you will find the famous hills with those terrace fields Jizan is known for. It is a great opportunity to get a close view of local traditions as well.

Why is Mecca not included here? One of the stated entry requirements with your tourist visa is that you can go anywhere inside Saudi Arabia except Mecca and Medina which are the two holiest religious sites for Muslims. These destinations are held sacred for Muslims and every year Muslims from around the world make a pilgrimage here. While tourists would find it very interesting, it is best to respect their rules and wishes and steer clear if you are not Muslim.

Where to Stay While Visiting Saudi Arabia

There are an abundance of hotels in most towns and cities. During our visit, we went luxury and stayed at the Four Seasons in Riyadh and the Sahary AlUla Resort in Al-Ula. Both of these offered great amenities and guides. However I will say that there are many many new options that have opened up since our last visit which include RV and desert glamping outside of Al Ula which is what we had hoped to find last time.

Regardless of where you wish to stay, plug in your dates on the map below to see all the options available within the country to see what is available when visiting Saudi Arabia. You can move the map around to see different areas – for now I have set it on Riyadh.

If you have the opportunity to visit Saudi Arabia I would highly recommend it as it is a unique country offering a glimpse into how tourism the tourism industry can just begin fresh. I would love to get back to some off the beaten areas including the eastern province.

What language do most people speak in Saudi Arabia? The official language of Saudi Arabia is Arabic which is used in business and other communication purposes. English is also widely spoken and is taught as a compulsory second language in schools though Arabic is the language spoken by a majority of the population.

The city of Jeddah on the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia

Are dietary requirements easily catered to here, as in any other middle eastern country? Yes, as long as this is advised in advance, dietary requirements can be catered for.

Is alcohol allowed in the country? Alcohol is prohibited in Saudi Arabia. It is very important that you do not try bringing in alcohol into the country. Even if you go to a 5 star hotel, they will not serve you alcohol. Do not purchase duty free on your way to Saudi Arabia.

Do places really close five times per day for prayer? Yes, mostly everything closes in the city (except airports, hospitals etc) five times a day during prayer time, lasting about 25-45 minutes each time.

Old Town Jeddah – a maze of charm and character

What sort of road quality would you expect in Saudi Arabia, especially with those high windy roads to viewpoints? Would the standard of the vehicles used by quite high? Roads in Saudi Arabia vary from eight-laned brand new freeways to small two-lane roads in rural areas and rocky unsealed mountain roads. The city highways and other major highways are well maintained, especially the roads in the capital Riyadh. The climate and terrain in Saudi Arabia provide major challenges for road construction. Temperatures can be ferociously high, particularly in desert areas for that reason you will find the roads vary from exceptionally great to very average in quality. All Crooked Compass travellers will be transported in air-conditioned new mini buses or SUV’s throughout their travels with us. For desert and mountain excursions, 4WD vehicles will be used to tackle the terrain.

Madain Saleh Saudi Arabia

Can you access all social media here? Yes, most hotels offer free wifi and there are no restrictions with accessing social media.

I have read about how you can get punished for cybercrimes by taking photos that violate someone else’s privacy (even if they are in the background) and publishing them online. Are there restrictions in general on taking photos or is it just if you are publishing them? There are restrictions around this but they vary from region to region – your guide will provide a detailed briefing in each location on the rules and regulation around taking photos. It is important that you follow their instructions and if you do not understand, please ask again.

Is it expensive in Saudi Arabia once you are there? Saudi Arabia is not the cheapest country. The official currency is the Saudi Rial, but it’s very easy to pay with a credit card in most places, especially inside the major cities.

And our most common question – Is Saudi Arabia safe? Saudi Arabia is governed by strict Islamic law but the country and its people are welcoming and hospitable. Like any destination, as long as you show respect to the local laws and customs and act respectfully, you are unlikely to encounter any issues.

Travel Regulations

Got your e-Visa sorted and all other required documents ready? Now it’s time to consider other important travel regulations before you set off on your journey to Saudi Arabia.



Saudi Arabia follows conservative Islamic practices. This means you need to dress modestly with clothing that covers your shoulders, arms and legs. If you’re visiting Saudi Arabia with your partner or spouse, avoid public displays of affection as it isn’t acceptable. You’ll also need to adhere to local customs and traditions, such as avoiding criticism of the royal family and respecting prayer times. We'll go into more detail on these points later on.



Another important factor to consider for your trip is travel insurance - while it’s not mandatory, having comprehensive travel insurance is highly recommended. This will cover you for medical emergencies, trip cancellations, lost belongings and other unforeseen situations, giving you peace of mind for your trip to Saudi Arabia. Make sure you’re up to date with any required vaccinations and health screenings before you travel. You’ll also need to be prepared for thorough security screenings at Saudi Arabian airports and cooperate with authorities if necessary.



Currency and Travel Budget

The official currency of Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Riyal (SAR). Keep an eye on currency exchange rates before your trip to get an idea of how much your money will be worth in Saudi Riyals. It’s worth noting that most major credit and debit cards are accepted in hotels, restaurants and shops, however, it's always a good idea to carry some cash for smaller establishments or places that may not accept cards.



To help you keep an eye on your budget for your Saudi Arabia trip, research and plan your expenses in advance, factoring in accommodations, transportation, meals, sightseeing and shopping. If you’re concerned about spending too much money during your travels, you can opt for cheap activities such as eating local street food, using public transportation, purchasing souvenirs and handicrafts, visiting mosques and historical sites, and exploring local markets (souks), all of which are budget-friendly options. On the other hand, if you plan to splash out and are ready to spend a lot of money, you can choose to stay at luxury hotels, opt for fine dining restaurants, purchase luxury brands and book private tours/exclusive experiences, which won’t be hard to find in Saudi Arabia.

Travel Advice You Need To Follow

So, you made it into Saudi Arabia - what now? Keep reading to find out more travel tips that can help you safely and respectfully navigate the beautiful nation of Saudi Arabia. Once you’re in Saudi Arabia, you’ll need to consider keeping yourself safe, respecting local laws and customs and dressing modestly. If you’re visiting Saudi Arabia’s bustling cities, such as Riyadh or Jeddah, make sure you are vigilant in crowded areas, especially during events or religious gatherings.



Dressing Modestly

Get to know the Saudi Arabian laws and avoid behaviours that could be considered disrespectful or offensive to the local culture. You can be respectful by dressing modestly as Saudi Arabia has a conservative dress code, especially for women. Women are advised to wear loose-fitting, modest clothing that covers the arms and legs - this could be a long tunic or top that extends below the hips and paired with pants or a long skirt. Women can also choose to wear an abaya (a loose-fitting black cloak). It’s not mandatory for non-Muslim women to wear a headscarf (hijab) however carrying one to cover your head in certain situations can be a sign of respect.



Men also need to dress modestly and avoid clothing such as shorts and sleeveless shirts. Wearing long trousers and a shirt with sleeves is recommended to avoid being disrespectful.



But what about swimwear? It’s generally acceptable to wear swimwear at private hotel beaches or pools, however, it is very inappropriate to wear revealing swimwear in public areas in Saudi Arabia. Try to opt for more modest swimwear options wherever possible.



It’s worth noting that the degree of enforcement of dress codes may vary depending on the region you’re visiting. Riyadh and Jeddah are considered to be more cosmopolitan than other regions of Saudi Arabia, therefore there may be more flexibility with what you can wear. But to avoid any trouble, try to dress as modestly as possible.



Be Respectful

As well as dressing modestly, there are a few do’s and don’ts that you should follow when visiting Saudi Arabia.

Do not show any public displays of affection (such as holding hands or hugging). This is considered to be inappropriate and offensive. Physical contact between unrelated men and women in public is also discouraged.

If you’re a non-Muslim visiting Saudi Arabia during the holy month of Ramadan, you need to avoid eating, drinking and smoking in public areas during daylight hours out of respect for Muslims who are fasting from sunrise to sunset.

It’s a given, but you should also ask for permission if you wish to take photos of people, especially women. If you’re visiting Saudi Arabia for a business trip, avoid scheduling meetings or appointments on Fridays as this is the Muslim holy day.

Whether you’re visiting Saudi Arabia as a tourist or for business purposes, following this advice means you’ll be able to demonstrate respect for the Saudi Arabian culture and create a positive impression.





Getting Around Saudi Arabia

You’re probably thinking “Great, I now know how to respect the Saudi Arabian culture and customs, but how do I actually get around the country?”. Saudi Arabia has a continuously expanding transportation network. Depending on the city you’re visiting, different modes of transportation will be available.



Public Transport

Saudi Arabia has been investing significantly in its public transportation network in order to improve connectivity between its cities and regions. Major cities like Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam have developed modern and efficient bus networks that provide an affordable and convenient way to get around. There’s no need to worry about getting too hot in a stuffy bus - Saudi Arabia’s buses are equipped with air conditioning and are always on time, making it a popular mode of transportation for both locals and tourists.



Other than buses, Saudi Arabia has introduced a high-speed railway system called the Haramain Train. This train connects key cities such as Mecca, Medina, Jeddah and King Abdullah Economic City. It’s a comfortable and efficient way to travel between these destinations, especially for those on pilgrimage leisure trips!



Taxis and Ride Sharing

Taxis are always available in Saudi Arabia. Many taxis in Saudi Arabia don’t have meters so it’s recommended that you negotiate a fare before starting your taxi ride. Make sure to use licensed taxis from reputable companies. You can also use ride-sharing services such as Uber and Careem. With these services, you’ll get upfront pricing and you can track your ride in real-time. Payment is done safely and securely through the app.



Car Rental

If public transportation isn’t your thing, you can opt for a car rental instead. Renting a car for your trip to Saudi Arabia is a great option if you’re planning to explore multiple cities in the country. Saudi Arabia has well-maintained highways and road networks, making your road trip more enjoyable. However, if you’re considering hiring a car, you’ll need to have an International Driving Permit (IDP), as well as a valid driver’s licence from your home country. You’ll need to familiarise yourself with local traffic rules and regulations - seat belts are mandatory for all passengers and mobile phone use while driving is strictly prohibited.



Domestic Flights

What if you want to explore all corners of Saudi Arabia? The easiest way to do this is by booking multi-city Saudi Arabia flights or domestic flights within Saudi Arabia. Popular airlines that operate these types of flights include Saudia, the nation’s flag carrier airline, Flynas, a Saudi low-cost airline, and Flyadeal. With these airlines, you can visit multiple destinations within Saudi Arabia, including Riyadh, Jeddah, Medina, Dammam, Abha, Tabuk and Gassim, among others. You could even book flights to NEOM!



Whichever mode of transportation you choose, it’s crucial that you plan ahead of time the cities/towns you wish to explore in Saudi Arabia so that you can have a stress-free, enjoyable experience without getting lost!



Language and Communication

Lastly, to ensure you have a smooth and respectful travel experience in Saudi Arabia, you’ll want to think about your communication with locals and using the Arabic language.



Basic Arabic Phrases

English is widely spoken in Saudi Arabia, however, making an effort to learn and use basic Arabic phrases can go a long way in enhancing your interactions and showing respect for the local culture during your Saudi Arabia trip. Some greetings you can learn include:

“As-salamu-alaykum” (peace be upon you)

“Wa alaykum as-salam” (and unto you peace)

“Marhaba” (hello)

“Shukran” (thank you)

“Min fadlik” (please)

Learning these words can help you break the ice and create positive connections with the locals. You should also try to learn numbers as these can be used for everyday transactions, especially if you’re planning to do some shopping while in Saudi Arabia and need to negotiate prices. It’s also a good idea to learn the names of the locations you wish to visit and the landmarks you want to see!



Respectful Communication

Greeting respectfully and politely addressing people is an important cultural practice in Saudi Arabia. When meeting someone, use the appropriate greeting depending on the time of day. Address people using titles and appropriate honorifics, such as “Sheikh” for an older man or “Sheikha” for an older woman.



When communicating with Saudi Arabian locals, you should be observant of non-verbal cues. Non-verbal communication plays a significant role in Saudi Arabian culture. It’s advised to maintain eye contact when speaking as this is a sign of attentiveness and respect. But avoid prolonged eye contact between unrelated men and women as this can be considered inappropriate. In general, maintain a relaxed and friendly demeanour during conversations.



Be wary of using hand gestures when communicating, especially hand gestures that are unfamiliar or potentially offensive to the local culture. Thumbs-up and peace signs are generally understood but it's best to rely on verbal communication wherever possible.



Learning any new language that you’re not familiar with can be difficult - try to be patient and approach every conversation with a friendly attitude, especially when you are trying to convey your needs or understand others. Embracing the Arabic language will enhance your Saudi Arabia travel experience and make it more fulfilling and unforgettable!



Ready to visit Saudi Arabia?

To summarise, embarking on a journey to Saudi Arabia requires a delicate balance of preparedness and respect for its rich culture and traditions. Navigating the visa process, embracing local customs, dressing modestly and effectively communicating through language and gestures are all essential elements for a fulfilling travel experience in Saudi Arabia. By immersing yourself in the beauty of the landscape and engaging with the warmth of its people, you'll create lasting memories while contributing to a mutual exchange of understanding and appreciation.

Most Common Questions on Saudi Arabia By a Tourist,"People are free to talk to the opposite gender, but make sure to respect the boundaries. Also, as a solo women traveler you are fairly treated in KSA."
The Convenient Travel Guide to Visiting Saudi Arabia,"Saudi Arabia used to be one of the most difficult countries to secure a tourist visa. Several years ago on a flight from Bangkok to Vietnam I remember reading an article mentioning that policies regarding travel to the country would be changing in the coming years. I made a mental note to keep an eye open for that. I was able to visit last year, spending the majority of my time in Dammam.

Traveling to Saudi Arabia can be an exhilarating adventure, with its unique blend of ancient traditions and modern innovations. The country is known for its vast deserts, vibrant cities, and rich cultural heritage; however tourism is just in its infancy. This article will provide you with essential tips and insights to make your visit to the Kingdom smooth and enjoyable.

Entry Requirements and Visa

First things first, ensure you have the appropriate visa. The introduction of the eVisa allows visitors from numerous countries to apply online. This process is straightforward and typically quick. However, always double-check the latest requirements on the official Saudi government website or consult your nearest Saudi embassy.

Best Time to Visit

Saudi Arabia’s climate is predominantly desert, with scorching summers and mild winters. And when its hot, its extremely hot; I visited in late June and the daytime temperatures in Dammam always hovered between 42 and 45 Celsius. The best time to visit is during the cooler months from October to April. During this period, temperatures are more bearable, especially for exploring outdoor attractions. Riyadh, Jeddah, and Al Ula can be particularly delightful in these months.

Respecting local customs and traditions is crucial. Public displays of affection are frowned upon, and it’s essential to be mindful of prayer times, as businesses often close briefly during these periods. My trip avoided Ramadan, the holy period that falls upon different dates each year; during this time eating and drinking in public are not allowed during daytime hours. This is something to be aware for not only travel to Saudi Arabia but also other Muslim countries.

Currency and Payments

The currency in Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Riyal (SAR). I had no problem using my U.S. issued credit cards while traveling in Dammam. However I had plenty of cash with me as well for smaller transactions like at local restaurants. ATMs are readily available; I notified my banks ahead of time of my travel plans.

Getting Around

I found transportation in Dammam challenging at times. It was hard to find public transportation and the city is so spread out. However, larger cities like Riyadh and Jeddah have well-developed public transportation systems, including buses and a metro in Riyadh. After wearing myself out by walking everywhere (especially in the heat), I discovered Uber was readily and easily available and for the rest of the trip used it to explore both Dammam and surrounding towns.

For long-distance travel, consider flying between cities. Domestic flights are frequent and relatively affordable. If you prefer a more scenic route, renting a car is a viable option. There are numerous options for this – one we absolutely do not recommend is International Drivers Association. We have talked to numerous other travelers who have had very bad experiences with this company. Saudi Arabia has an extensive road network, but remember to carry your international driving permit and familiarize yourself with local driving laws.

Dress Code and Cultural Etiquette

Saudi Arabia has a conservative dress code influenced by Islamic traditions. While the dress code has relaxed slightly for tourists, it’s important to dress modestly. Men should avoid wearing shorts in public places, and women should wear loose-fitting clothes that cover their arms and legs. An abaya (a long, black cloak) is no longer mandatory for women, but carrying one for visits to more traditional areas is advisable. I went swimming in the Persian Gulf several times and always jumped in wearing both long pants and a shirt.

Accommodation

Saudi Arabia offers a wide range of accommodation options, from luxury hotels to budget-friendly guesthouses. In major cities, you’ll find international hotel chains that provide a high standard of comfort and service. For a more authentic experience, think about staying in traditional Arabian accommodations, such as boutique hotels or desert camps.

Must-See Attractions

Saudi Arabia offers a plethora of attractions catering to diversity of interests. Here are some must-see spots:

Riyadh: The capital city is a fascinating blend of the old and new. Visit the historical Al Masmak Fortress, explore the National Museum, and marvel at the modern Kingdom Centre Tower, where you can enjoy panoramic views of the city.

Jeddah: Known as the gateway to Mecca, Jeddah is famous for its Red Sea coastline. Stroll along the Jeddah Corniche, dive into the rich marine life, and explore the historic Al-Balad district with its traditional coral houses.

Al Ula: This hidden gem is home to the UNESCO World Heritage site of Hegra (Madain Saleh). Discover ancient tombs carved into sandstone mountains, and don’t miss the breathtaking Elephant Rock.

Cuisine

Saudi Arabian cuisine is a blend of flavors and traditions. Don’t miss out on trying Kabsa, a spiced rice dish with meat, or Mandi, a fragrant rice and meat dish cooked in an underground oven. For a sweet treat, indulge in Baklava or Ma’amoul; I found plenty of bakeries in Dammam. Traditional coffee (Gahwa) and dates are a quintessential part of Saudi hospitality. I discovered only a few international restaurants during my stay in Dammam.

Safety and Health

My time in Saudi Arabia felt and was extremely safe and safety was the least of my concerns. Healthcare facilities are of high quality in major cities, but it’s always advisable to have travel insurance that covers medical expenses.

Final Tips

Language: Arabic is the official language, but English is widely understood in tourist areas and by younger generations. Most of my communication was with younger Uber drivers; for some reason they never initiated conversation but once I did so, they opened up.

Electricity: The standard voltage is 230V, and the plug type is G. Carry an adapter if your devices have a different plug type.

Water: Tap water is safe to use for washing, but it’s recommended to drink bottled water.

With its rich history, diverse landscapes, and welcoming people, Saudi Arabia is a destination that promises a memorable journey. And it is a country that is interested in building tourism. It is the only country where post trip, I received a survey directly from the government asking numerous questions about my time in the country, with requests for how to improve their tourism.

Travel In Saudi Arabia: The Ultimate Guide,"Planning a trip to Saudi Arabia? Here’s what you need to know to travel to Saudi Arabia, from costs to what to wear to safety and cultural deets. Happy planning!

Saudi Arabia has long been closed off for most travelers. Restrictive visa policies meant only Muslims—or oil industry workers—could visit. Even then, they could only visit a few places in the country.

Then everything changed in 2019. *Cue Avatar: The Last Airbender theme*

Saudi Arabia is currently making a big push to rebrand itself as a premier holiday destination in the Middle East. Part of that push involves a more open e-visa policy. This new visa regime makes it significantly easier for many nationalities to visit the country. It also allows pilgrims on Hajj and Umrah to travel beyond Mecca and Medina.

Whether or not Saudi Arabia is a top travel destination is another matter, but if you plan on visiting Saudi Arabia, you definitely need to come prepared to avoid offense. Read on to learn all the things I wish I’d known before traveling to Saudi Arabia!

Saudi Arabia travel guide: here’s what you need to know

Saudi Arabia basics

Official name: Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)

Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) Capital: Riyadh

Riyadh Population: 34 million

Saudi Arabia is the 12th largest country in the world by landmass. Its population is youthful; of the approximately 34 million people living in the country, 50% are younger than 25.

Expats (foreigners) make up a significant part of its population—more than 30% of people living in KSA are foreign nationals. Interestingly enough, this foreign minority makes up more than 70% of Saudi’s workforce. Interpret that how you will.

The kingdom in its current form was founded in 1932 as an absolute monarchy. This means most of the power in Saudi Arabia lies in the hands of the royal family, the House of Saud, who rule the kingdom to this day. The current monarch is King Salman… but his son, Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS), more or less runs the kingdom. MBS is also responsible for the Vision 2030 program that spurred the recent tourism developments.

The Arabian peninsula is the founding place of Islam, one of the world’s largest religions. Its two holiest cities, Medina and Mecca, are both in Saudi Arabia. They are the main destinations of the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages that millions of Muslims from around the world undertake every year. Religion is critical in Saudi Arabia; for more on religion in Saudi Arabia, see the religion section.

When’s the best time to visit Saudi Arabia?

Definitely do not visit Saudi Arabia in summer.

Summers in Saudi can be boiling hot, with temperatures exceeding 40°C. Unless you’re a masochist, it’s best to avoid traveling to Saudi in summer. The mountains of Asir province are one notable exception to the summer rule; though temperatures can still be high, the cloudy, mountainous terrain is generally quite pleasant during summer.

The best time to visit Saudi Arabia is in winter, roughly between October and March. Temperatures are at their most pleasant between November and February. Temperatures typically begin rising from the end of February or beginning of March, though one can never be quite certain thanks to climate change. Winter temperatures hover around 25°C – 30°C, depending on where in the country you are.

Visas for Saudi Arabia

It used to be a real pain to get a Saudi Arabia visa. Unless you were a Muslim going on a pilgrimage or an exec visiting/working for business, it was nearly impossible to go to Saudi Arabia.

Before 2019, some travelers managed to get in via “business” trips booked by tour companies. Saudi Arabia began issuing tourist visas specifically for ticketed events in 2018. However, for the most part, Saudi Arabia was a non-option for the average tourist.

In 2019, everything changed with the introduction of the new e-visa system. The new Saudi Arabia e-visa system is surprisingly easy. I was legitimately taken aback when I applied—It took me less than 15 minutes to apply for my visa, I stood up to go to the bathroom after finishing the application, and by the time I returned to my computer 5 minutes later I had a Saudi Arabia e-visa PDF waiting in my Whatsapp inbox.

What to pack for travel in Saudi Arabia

Everyone has different needs, but there are a few items I strongly recommend you pack when traveling in Saudi Arabia:

Modest clothes. This one is a given—Saudi is an Islamic country, after all—but men and women alike need to make an effort to stay covered up.

Saudi uses the same G-type plugs (3 rectangular holes) that you find in the UK. If you’re coming from Europe or the US, you’ll need a travel adapter for Saudi Arabia. I always travel with several of these adapters since they also have USB outlets.

I always travel with several of these adapters since they also have USB outlets. Reusable water bottle. Plastic waste is a huge issue in Saudi Arabia, and people love to buy painfully tiny plastic bottles of water. Do your part for the planet—bring your own water bottle. Tap water is generally safe to drink, and water filters are common in metro areas. I love and recommend my Hydroflask insulated water bottle. It also kept water cold when it was boiling hot!

These travel mugs are great, and insulate both hot and cold drinks.

Plus you’re going to get some freaky tan lines from all your modest clothing! I always travel with this specific sunscreen because it doesn’t feel slimy or sticky in the slightest.

I always travel with this specific sunscreen because it doesn’t feel slimy or sticky in the slightest. Arabic phrasebook. English isn’t very common, especially outside cities. I used Google Translate often… but no one understood me, and it was total crap at translating Saudi’s Arabic dialect. I highly recommend this Arabic phrasebook—it’s specific to one of the major dialects in KSA.

Language in Saudi Arabia

The official language of Saudi Arabia is—yep, you guessed it—Arabic.

However, Arabic is more nuanced than non-Arabic speakers might realize. Arabic spoken in, say, Morocco, is far different from the Arabic you’ll hear in Saudi Arabia.

The three main variants of Arabic spoken in Saudi are:

Najdi Arabic

Hejazi Arabic

Gulf Arabic

It’s both useful and respectful to pick up some basic Arabic or have a phrasebook on hand for short interactions. Careful, as most Arabic phrasebooks are written for Moroccan or Egyptian Arabic; I specifically recommend using this Hejazi Arabic phrasebook, which covers one of the main dialects you’ll encounter in Saudi Arabia. Never fear, it doesn’t require any struggling with the Arabic alphabet—all the phrases are written in the Roman alphabet.

English in Saudi Arabia? English isn’t widely spoken in Saudi, though people in the tourism sector will often speak some English. More and more young Saudis speak English, as many study abroad for university. Most road signs on main roads are written with both Arabic and Roman alphabets, though speed limit signs are Arabic-only once you get away from Jeddah and Riyadh.

Due to the large number of foreigners living in Saudi—roughly 30% of Saudi’s population comes from abroad—it’s also common to hear people speak Tagalog, Urdu, and Hindi, among other languages. Many of the labor or customer service workers you’ll run into in Saudi are from India, Pakistan, and the Philippines; you can easily travel in many places without Arabic if you speak some Hindi/Urdu. Speaking from experience.

The Arabic alphabet

The Arabic alphabet is written from right to left, and, in my humble opinion, complicated AF. Many letters are drastically different depending on where in the word they fall (beginning/middle/end) and a single dot can change the entire sound of a letter.

Despite its complexity, learning just a handful of letters can be immensely helpful for figuring out signs and differentiating between options. I used the free app Duolingo to learn the Arabic alphabet while traveling in Saudi Arabia. And by learn, I mostly mean shouting exasperatedly at my phone as it asked me to make guttural noises and read incomprehensible squiggles, neither of which I could never dream of reproducing.

Even if you aren’t linguistically inclined, I recommend learning Arabic numerals. They are not as difficult (there are only 10 of them, after all) and you’ll need to know them to read things like prices and speed limit signs if traveling Saudi Arabia by car.

Religion in Saudi Arabia

Religion influences every part of Saudi life. Saudi citizens have to be Muslim, and publicly practicing any religion other than Islam is forbidden.

Everything shuts down during namaz, prayer times. In Sunni Islam, there are five prayer times every day: fajr, duhr, asr, maghrib, and isha. The timings change slightly each day—here are today’s prayer times.

Shops, restaurants, cafes—basically everything except for fancier places hidden from sight—will close for around 15 minutes to half an hour during prayer times. Previously, religious police would hound anyone seen not praying during prayer times, but those times are over.

The vast majority of Saudi’s Muslim population is Sunni. There is a Shia minority, which suffers from regular discrimination.

Though there are a few schools of Islamic thought in Saudi Arabia; Wahabis and Salafis make up a significant part of the Sunni population. Both involve relatively strict and traditional interpretations of the Quran.

Minority religions in Saudi Arabia

Because Saudi has such a large immigrant population, notably from places like the Philippines and the Indian Subcontinent, there are also pockets of Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, and Buddhists in Saudi. However, they are not allowed to openly worship or practice their faith.

Proselytizing is strictly forbidden, and can come in many forms—distributing non-Islamic materials such as Bibles is considered proselytizing and is highly illegal.

You are allowed to practice your religion in private as a non-Muslim traveling to Saudi. However, try to be discreet. Under no circumstances should you try to argue with Saudis about their religion.

Atheism in Saudi Arabia? As with any country, there are always outliers. Atheists do exist in Saudi Arabia, but they must be very secretive about their beliefs—atheism is not welcome in Saudi. Even if you don’t have religious beliefs, I recommend saying you have a religion when traveling in Saudi Arabia.

Culture in Saudi Arabia

Saudi culture is heavily influenced by several major pillars: Islam, its historic role as a major trade center, and Bedouin (nomadic desert tribes) roots. Generally, Saudi culture is deeply religious, family-oriented, protectively traditional, and socially conservative.

Clothes and what to wear in Saudi Arabia

One of the first things any visitor to Saudi will notice is how many people wear traditional clothes.

Even in major cities like Riyadh and Jeddah most men still wear thobe, the long, loose robes coming to the ankles. The vast majority of women in Saudi Arabia are completely covered in black abayas, long, loose robes for women, and hijab head coverings. Most women cover their faces when out in public.

As a tourist visiting Saudi Arabia, it’s required by law to dress modestly. You don’t have to go out and buy a thob ASAP, but there are some basic requirements to keep in mind.

Men: Men should avoid tank tops or walking around shirtless—t-shirts at the very minimum—and long pants are strongly recommended. Islam requires men’s knees to be covered, and you will stick out like a sore thumb if you walk around in shorts and a wife beater tank.

Women: Though foreign women are no longer required to wear abayas, I still strongly recommend female travelers wear them in public in cities and towns. Unless you’re hanging out with elites or in someone’s home, you will be the only woman not wearing one 99% of the time. You can wear whatever you’d like underneath—I often wore a t-shirt and jeans—but an abaya is ideal. Headscarves are not mandatory, though in many areas I wore one to avoid people’s stares.

Smells in Saudi: Scents and smelling good are highly prioritized in Saudi Arabia. Men and women alike wear scents, cars must smell good, and greeting guests with bukhoor (a sort of goblet-shaped incense holder, usually to burn oud wood) is common. You don’t have to smell like a perfume shop all the time, but know people will be very aware of how you smell. A bit of an embarrassing issue for me, an often-smelly backpacker.

Gender divides and how to act in Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia is heavily segregated by gender. Men operate in one sphere, women in another.

Even within families, it is common for women to stay out of sight or hidden from men. I met many men who do not know what their extended female family look like, and women who would cover themselves in front of their husband’s brothers. Just to give you an example of how extreme the segregation can be.

Practically, for travelers the gender divide is most noticeable when it comes to eating. It is no longer required by law, but many restaurants are still divided into men and women/family sections. Some restaurants do not allow women at all. Men cannot sit in the women’s section unless accompanied by women; women usually cannot sit in the men’s sections, though sometimes more progressive restaurant owners will be flexible about the rule if the restaurant is mostly empty.

The extremity of segregation varies around the country. In small towns, you likely won’t see women at all. In Jeddah and wealthy parts of Riyadh, you’ll see more men and women mixing these days.

How to act around the opposite gender is something that varies from person to person. Here are some general tips to keep in mind:

Do not touch the opposite gender. This includes handshakes; only shake hands if the local offers first, though they probably won’t.

This includes handshakes; only shake hands if the local offers first, though they probably won’t. Try to avoid making unnecessary eye contact with strangers of the opposite gender if you’re not interacting with them, especially as a man. Men can get defensive if you stare at their wives/sisters.

with strangers of the opposite gender if you’re not interacting with them, especially as a man. Men can get defensive if you stare at their wives/sisters. Don’t sit next to the opposite gender unless you’re with them or related to them.

unless you’re with them or related to them. No PDAs you traveling couples. Though you’ll see married couples holding hands sometimes, anything beyond that is inappropriate and a punishable offense.

Hospitality and gift giving in Saudi Arabia

Hospitality is another core element of culture in Saudi Arabia.

As in many Islamic societies, guests are seen as a gift from God. Taking care of guests is an opportunity to do good and win favor in the eyes of Allah. When traveling in Saudi Arabia, don’t be surprised if you’re given gifts, taken out to dinner, or shown around for an entire day “because you’re our guest.” Let it be noted that the whiter you are, the more likely this will occur.

You might be tempted to give your hosts a gift as thanks, but you probably shouldn’t. Though they’ll happily shower you with gifts, many Saudis will take offense to gifts given to them by new acquaintances/non-relations. Proper gifts are usually quite expensive—think fancy carpets or expensive scents—so unless you’re visiting a family or long-time friend, don’t feel pressured to bring gifts. Just appreciation.

Female travel in Saudi Arabia

Traveling as a woman in Saudi Arabia is worlds apart from traveling as a man.

Even if you’re a female traveler traveling with a man, people will treat you very differently from male travelers. Women are treated with great respect in Saudi Arabia, though “respect” in Saudi Arabia might be viewed as restriction by others.

The status of women in Saudi Arabia is complex—one I’m not exactly qualified to discuss—so let’s stick to practical travel matters. Because genders are so segregated in Saudi, it can be hard to find women to interact with outside of the big cities. You need to be far more attentive to your clothing than men. Finding places to eat that allow women can be a bit of a nightmare in small towns—you’ll have to get used to takeaway meals.

On the “bright” side, because the punishment for harassment is so severe—and official harassment can be something as simple as a man staring at you for too long—female travelers are generally not at risk of more severe assault. I encountered some verbal harassment and men following me, and a few solo female travelers I spoke to were propositioned for sex, but harassment should not be a major concern for female travelers.

In my personal experience, both solo and traveling with men, I often found traveling in Saudi Arabia as a woman to be isolating more than anything else. As a disclaimer, part of that could be attributed to my appearance—most people thought I was either Arab or Indian/Pakistani—as I heard more glowing stories from white women.

I could go on for a long while on female travel in Saudi Arabia, but I’ll stop here. For a more in-depth discussion, check out my guide to female travel in Saudi Arabia.

Food in Saudi Arabia

If you love food, prepare to put on a few pounds in Saudi Arabia. I know I did.

Saudi Arabia has long been a crossroads of cultures. Traders came in by horse and camel from the north, while others came by sea. Muslim pilgrims from all over the world have traveled to Mecca for centuries.

As a result, Saudi cuisine draws on many different influences, and many common dishes in Saudi Arabia actually have origins elsewhere. Fuul (beans), falafel, and shawarma are diet staples, though not traditionally Saudi.

Some traditional Saudi dishes to look out for include:

Kabsa – Roast chicken and rice found everywhere

Dates – Saudi Arabia has some of the best dates in the world, and they come in all different types and flavors. The Qassim region is considered to have the best dates in the country.

Jareesh – Crushed wheat porridge, topped with savory onions and dried limes

Murtabak – Stuffed pancake

Tharid – Spicy lamb stew served with bread

Laban – Creamy yogurt drink

Mamuul – Stuffed date cookies

Arabic coffee – Not at all like “normal” coffee, it’s yellow, bitter, and flavored with cardamom

Meals in Saudi Arabia are rich, spiced, and usually accompanied by a mound of rice or bread, as well as thick, creamy laban (a strained kind of yogurt that can also stand alone as a drink—it’s delicious!). Meat is an essential part of main meals, and sweet tea often follows.

Eating customs in Saudi Arabia

There is definitely a right and wrong way to eat in Saudi Arabia! Though you’ll probably be forgiven for any culinary cultural faux pas as a foreign visitor, it’s still good to respect norms.

Traditionally, meals are eaten on a mat on the ground, and everyone eats from a large, central plate. Usually, there are boxy pillows on the ground you can lean up against for support.

Food is eaten by hand. Don’t worry, washing hands before and after all meals is customary. Eat with your right hand only (left hands are for dirty business), unless doing something more complicated like picking a chicken bone apart. Only pass food with your right hand, even if it’s dirty.

When sitting on the ground, try to keep your legs crossed or knees bent. It’s considered rude to extend your feet in front of people you respect, especially if your feet are pointing towards them.

Saudis will usually press you to eat more, and refill your cup whenever your coffee or tea is finished. It’s expected to let them refill your cup at least once. As for eating, it’s best to start saying you’re full well before you’re stuffed to the brim… else you might be stuffed beyond the brim.

Confused about how to eat? Here’s a video on eating customs in the Middle East to give you an idea of how and why people eat the way they do. The vlogger isn’t Saudi, but the same principles apply.

Traveling as a vegetarian/vegan in Saudi Arabia

Though meat is a meal staple, there are plenty of vegetarian- and vegan-friendly foods to be found in Saudi Arabia if you look.

Some upmarket establishments have vegan options. Vegetarian restaurants exist in big cities. Though you might encounter some raised eyebrows, vegetarians and vegans are increasingly common in Saudi Arabia—one of Saudi’s princes is vegan. In general, people in cities understand what vegetarians are.

Some common foods you can rely on as a vegetarian or vegan (*) traveler include:

Falafel* (if no yogurt)

Fuul (beans)*

Vegetable murtabak (stuffed pancakes)*

Dal tamiz (lentils with bread)*

Hummus*

Moutabel (baba ghanoush)*

Masoub (Yemeni banana and bread pudding)

Here are more food options for vegetarians in Saudi Arabia.

Money and payments in Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia uses the Saudi Riyal (SAR). One Riyal is divided into 100 halalas. Saudi has banknotes and coins, although the coins are mostly useless. However, don’t be surprised if you end up with a stack of one and two riyal coins (and a bunch of halalas to boot). At the time of writing, 1 riyal is $0.27 or €0.25. Check here for the current exchange rate.

Paying with credit card

It’s possible to pay by international credit card for most large transactions such as nice meals, car rentals, and hotels. Google Pay is also quite popular in Saudi Arabia—many people just use their phones to pay in cities.

Cash and ATMs

Banknotes come in 5, 10, 50, 100, and 500 riyals. Make sure to withdraw an amount from the ATM that isn’t easily divided into 500 notes; you don’t want to be stuck with a stack of large banknotes. Many places will have some change, but not always enough to break a 500.

Getting money from the ATM is straightforward (there are even drive-through ATMs), and there aren’t any hidden ATM fees to worry about.

Transportation in Saudi Arabia

Saudi is absolutely massive; getting around takes time. Cities are spread out, and there’s hardly any public transport to speak of. Even between cities—which can easily be more than 500 km apart—public transport is limited.

By rental car

Saudi Arabia is made for cars, especially 4x4s. Saudi’s most memorable spots are all outside the cities; I highly recommend you rent a car to make the most of your trip to Saudi. My guide to road tripping in Saudi has all the information you need.

Note on cars: I’ve heard of unofficial shared taxis offering rides between cities, though I didn’t use any myself. A local told me you can sometimes find them lurking outside of major bus terminals.

By plane

If you’re short on time, or if you only want to visit a few main cities, planes are the most efficient (and often cost-effective) way of getting between cities. Most flights are less than two hours. Some are even cheaper than bus tickets.

By bus

SAPTCO runs an extensive bus network throughout Saudi Arabia. Buses are clean and comfortable, though on the pricey side. Expect to pay at least US$50 per person for a long distance bus ticket.

For more info on traveling by bus in Saudi Arabia, check out the Saudi Arabia Public Transport Company (SAPTCO) website.

Transport within cities

Ride sharing apps Uber and Careem are commonly used in big cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah.

Safety in Saudi Arabia

Many people have asked me: Is Saudi safe? I think Saudi is generally a safe place to travel to. Although it’s had problems with violence and terrorism in the past, most areas in Saudi are perfectly safe for the average tourist.

The only area considered dangerous is the area along the Yemeni border around Najran. Tourists are allowed to visit, but most governments advise against travel there. Saudi is currently in talks with the Yemen rebels to negotiate a truce. However, some security experts are fearful the rebels might launch a ground offensive on Najran if their demands aren’t met. If you plan on traveling to the south, make sure to keep an eye on the current situation.

Safety issues for travelers in Saudi Arabia

Drivers are the biggest safety hazard in Saudi Arabia. Many drivers drive like crazy, so be careful when crossing the street or driving around the country.

Openly talking about politics or the royal family with people you don’t know well is not wise. Saudi critics of the royal family have been jailed.

Criticizing Islam is absolutely to be avoided for a variety of reasons.

Drugs, including alcohol, are illegal in Saudi Arabia. They do exist—alcohol is common especially among elite and/or foreign circles and khat is a stimulant commonly consumed in the south—but possession is a punishable offense.

Mobiles and connectivity in Saudi Arabia

Saudi is fairly well connected. There’s 4G service almost everywhere, even on long stretches of highway in the middle of nowhere. Many cafes and hotels have decent wifi, though mobile signal is often better.

There are several mobile operators in Saudi Arabia. STC, Mobily, and Zain are the three main operators in the Kingdom. I used both STC and Mobily while in Saudi, and highly recommend using STC.

STC’s coverage is the best of the three; I had 4G practically everywhere, even out in nature. Price-wise, Mobily is slightly cheaper, but has poorer service outside of cities and towns. Zain is the cheapest option, but also has the worst coverage outside metro areas.

If you want to get a SIM card, I recommend getting one upon arrival in the airport (if you fly in). The main carriers all have small offices at arrivals, and it’s easy to get a card here as the workers all speak English. It’s possible to get SIM cards in cities, but only at official stores, and workers will be less likely to speak English.

The price for a SIM card with 10GB data is roughly 160 SAR. A 10GB top up is 100 SAR. For info on costs, check out my Saudi budget report.

A week in Saudi : Travel guide to Riyadh and Jeddah,"When I recently got the opportunity to visit Saudi, I was super thrilled cos its a destination that has been high on my bucketlist due to its epic landscapes, rich heritage and vibrant culture. From the commercial centre of Jeddah – home to the UNESCO Old Town and one of the world’s few Formula 1 tracks – to the breathtaking Red Dunes and mesmerizing Diriyah in the capital, Riyadh, Saudi – to the magnificent desert and history in Al Ula – Saudi has so much to offer in terms of tourism.

I spent my week in Riyadh and Jeddah so I will only be covering these two destinations in my blog post. However if you are planning a trip I would highly recommend you add Al Ula, its so high on both mine and Anush’s bucketlist, we will definitely be planning a trip back to visit the Al Ula!

So without further adieu here is my quick travel guide to Riyadh and Jeddah.

Do you need a visa to go there ?

In 2019, Saudi opened its borders to tourism for the first time ever with the launch of their E-Visa program. Open to 49 countries in markets including North America, Europe and Asia, the E-Visa allows citizens of these countries to apply for a 90-day tourist visa. If you are not from any of the eligible countries you can get a visa on arrival (if you hold a multiple entry US, UK or Schengen visa in the tourist or business category) or apply at your local consulate prior to your trip.

How many days ?

1 week minimum to 10 days – you can split your time across Riyadh, Jeddah and Al Ula. All these destinations are accessible by a quick domestic flight.

How to get around ?

We got around using pre arranged taxis with drivers. Go Zahid arranges this all over Saudi.

Things to know :

Dress code for women : Saudi does not require you to wear a hijab, it is optional. It is only mandatory when you are entering mosques. Modest dress code is advisable wherein you are expected to cover your chest, shoulders, midriff. Anything below the kneees is acceptable length wise. I packed a ton of maxi dresses, abayas, loose trousers and blouses, kaftans, scarves. Its a great idea to always have a scarf on you – both for the weather as well as incase you want to visit a mosque.

Some of my Saudi outfits :

No alcohol is served anywhere in Saudi.

Language : Arabic is the official language of Saudi Arabia and the primary language used in all dealings and public transactions.English serves as an informal second language in the Kingdom and is spoken by a large section of its society.

Saudi Arabia’s national currency is the Saudi riyal (SAR).

Local delicacies to try – Shakshuka, Kabsa, Hummus, etc. Kabsa is considered the national dish of Saudi. The flavorful rice is topped with roast chicken, meat, or even fish, and a tomato and chili salsa is often served on the side to brighten it up.

RIYADH :

Riyadh is the birthplace of modern Saudi Arabia, where old- world charm meets 21st-century vision. Riyadh translates to “the Gardens,” a reference to the area’s past that dates to the 14th century, when the land was revered for its fertile soil, many canals and trees.

Today, Riyadh Province, also known as Al Wosta, is home to the country’s capital: a modern metropolis with a thriving financial and business center and a growing cultural scene. Riyadh’s blend of medieval and millennial makes for a beguiling cultural union — one where Arabia’s first roots can be traced, and where its bold future can be envisioned.

The city’s fascinating, centuries- old history can be found within its atmospheric souqs, compelling museums and ancient architecture, but it’s also a modern metropolis, with glittering high-rises and a burgeoning contemporary art scene.

How to Get Around in Saudi Arabia,"Buses, trains, cheap flights, and taxis – getting around Saudi Arabia is much easier than you might think.

Just a few years ago, Saudi Arabia was one of the most secluded countries in the world, and tourism was not even permitted. Well, the situation has drastically changed. Saudi Arabia now welcomes tourists and is building a tourism infrastructure larger than that of the UAE and Qatar.

I visited Saudi Arabia during its initial opening phase and now I’m planning a second trip in the coming days. I loved traveling overland in Saudi Arabia and this time, I have plans of taking buses to remote areas, a train to the holy city of Madina and even hitchhike. With everything set to go, I want to show you what I learnt and tell you how you can get around Saudi Arabia using buses, the new train system, taxis, ride-hailing apps, and car rentals.

I visited Saudi Arabia right after the country opened for tourism. First thing I did: Get a traditional outfit.

Entering Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia is investing large resources to become a main stopover destination for travelers moving between Asia and Europe. With Saudia, the largest carrier in Saudi Arabia, becoming a large competitor against Qatar Airways, Emirates, and Etihad, the aviation landscape is evolving rapidly.

Budget airlines such as Fly Dubai and even WizzAir have also entered the market, and it’s only a matter of time before we see flights from Europe with Ryanair or EasyJet.

Riyadh, Jeddah, or Dammam are the three largest airports in the country and are likely to be your initial points of entry into Saudi Arabia. Moreover, with a straightforward e-visa process for most nationalities, Saudi Arabia is poised to attract a growing number of tourists in the coming years.

I hold a Colombian passport and usually have to apply for a visa at the embassy if I want to visit Saudi Arabia. However, some exceptions might apply to you too.

For travelers requiring an e-visa or opting for visa on arrival, here is the link to apply for an e-visa.

For visa-required visitors holding US, UK, or EU visas, here is the link to obtain an e-visa.

Tip: Book your accommodation with Agoda

Be connected at all times in Saudi Arabia.

I got a e-SIM with SIM Local and got packages depending on my internet consumption.

They offer packages from 1, 3, 5, 10 and even 20 GB.

They also have a current discount of 10% at the link here.

Riyadh became a very popular starting point for a trip in Saudi Arabia

Traveling Between Cities with National Flights

Saudi Arabia is big! Very big, and traveling long distances within the country can be time-consuming. Domestic flights offer a convenient and efficient means of transportation for intercity travel.

Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam serve as major transportation hubs, with the two local airlines, Saudia and Flynas, operating regular flights between major domestic destinations. This makes it easy to explore different regions of the country without taking lengthy road journeys.

Additionally, the strategic locations of these airports, Damman very east, Riyadh in the center of Saudi Arabia and Jeddah in the west coast, enable travelers to access a significant portion of the country by visiting these three key hubs.

Other popular destinations in Saudi Arabia, such as Madina (recently opened for tourism) and Al Ula, have also several daily flights departing from these hubs, with fares starting at 50 EUR in low season.

During my first trip to Saudi Arabia, I traveled by train from Dammam to Riyadh, flew from Riyadh to AlUla and then flew again from AlUla to Jeddah.

Witnessing Eerie Landscapes with the Saudi Arabian Train System

Traveling by train is among the most enjoyable and convenient ways to get around Saudi Arabia. The country boasts the best train infrastructure in the entire Arabian Peninsula, and with ongoing expansions, it’s only a matter of time before the entire country and neighboring nations are interconnected.

Currently, there are two operational sections of the train system, each operated by different companies.

Saudi Arabia Railways connecting the east of the country

The Haramain High-Speed Railway connecting the west of the country

Thankfully, there are numerous trains operating throughout the day, making last-minute ticket purchases hassle-free.

Trains Connecting Eastern Saudi Arabia

Saudia Arabia Railways operates two passenger train lines. One connects the capital, Riyadh, to the coastal city of Dammam (4 hours), while the other links Riyadh to Al Quorayyat near the Jordanian border (11 hours).

The Al Quorayyat – Riyadh line will take you to the closest town to the Jordan border.

For travelers on the Dammam-Riyadh line, I highly recommend a stopover in the city of Al Hofuf. Located right in the middle of the desert, Al Hofuf is a charming town that I had the pleasure of visiting during my first trip to Saudi Arabia. It’s an ideal location for an overnight stay, or if your time is limited, a short, but rewarding day trip.

A train between Dammam and Riyadh will take 4 hours

Trains Connecting Western Saudi Arabia

The Haramain High-Speed Railway connects Jeddah with the holy cities of Mecca and Madina. Bookings for this service are made through a separate website. Link Here. With one of the fastest trains globally serving these destinations, this is the optimal choice for travel within this region of Saudi Arabia.

Moreover, this train route passes through Jeddah’s International Airport, making it a convenient starting point for your Saudi Arabian journey. During my upcoming trip, I plan to take this train to visit the city of Madina, which recently opened for tourism. It’s an incredible opportunity to explore one of the holiest cities globally.

The Mecca – Jeddah – Madina train line in Saudi Arabia connects millions of pilgrims every day.

Unlike Madina, Mecca is still limited to Muslim pilgrims and even though there is not any control to “verify your religion at the entrance”, it would be a lack of respect to visit this city just for the sake of visiting Mecca. I have read in forums about travelers bragging their visits to Mecca, and I find it very disrespectful to visit a forbidden city just for saying you have been there.

Upcoming train lines in Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia is also planning to open a few more important lines in the next years. The GCC line should connect the countries of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE by train, and there is a connecting line between Jeddah and Riyadh under construction.

Keep in mind, railway tickets with Saudi Arabian Railways and with the Haramain High-Speed Railway are only a fraction of the price compared to flights (even with the budget airlines), and the trains in Saudi Arabia are brand new – making the experience of taking a train in Saudi Arabia a total treat. This is my favorite way to travel in Saudi Arabia, and I can’t wait for the upcoming lines (especially the GCC line) to open.

The GCC line will become one of the most important transport train connections in Asia

International and national buses

Even though Saudi Arabia’s neighboring countries are not yet connected with high-speed trains or budget flights, buses are quite reliable for those who want to combine Saudi Arabia with Bahrain or the UAE.

International buses in Saudi Arabia

For international travel, SAPTCO is the only company that offers bus connections between Saudi Arabia and these countries. Tickets are quite affordable, and all departures start from the city of Dammam.

A trip from Dammam to Dubai takes around 13 hours, or a trip from Dammam to Bahrain takes only 2.5 hours. Unfortunately, there are only one or two connections every day, and booking a ticket at least a few days in advance is recommended.

I visited Bahrain using the SAPTCO bus connecting Dammam and Bahrain. I booked everything online

What about buses between Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar?

Unfortunately, there are no buses connecting these destinations. Travelers wanting to visit Qatar from Saudi Arabia have to travel with a private transfer or take a flight. In Qatar, non-GCC travelers also have issues entering the country with their own cars, so don’t try it.

For Kuwait is exactly the same. The easiest option is to get to the border town and from there arrange a private vehicle to cross you. I did this to get from Dammam to Bahrain and it worked very well. It was very expensive though.

And yes, you can get VOA (visa on arrival) at any of the land borders in Saudi Arabia (if your nationality applies for it).

NOTE: SAPTCO also manages most municipal buses in Saudi Arabia, but for the intermunicipal buses, SAPTCO is rebranded as Satrans for national intercity buses.

Getting a Saudi visa is everyday easier. It’s just a matter of time until the country becomes visa free for everyone.

National buses in Saudi Arabia

For those wanting to travel between Saudi Arabia by bus, there are two companies available on the market:

This is the most affordable way of traveling around Saudi Arabia, but also the least efficient and slowest. Buses from Riyadh to Jeddah with Satrans take around 12 hours and cost around 50 EUR one way. This is not worth the price, taking into consideration that a flight might cost only 20 EUR more and take only 1 hour.

While Satrans also connects Jeddah with Riyadh, most bus stations from Satrans are located in the south of the country.

Here is a map of all Satrans stations located in Saudi Arabia.

For travelers going north, Northwest Bus is their best option. Here, you can find bus connections to Madina and even to AlUla.

With local buses you can easily get to AlUla. Saudi Arabia’s big highlight.

Car rentals for total freedom

Car rentals in Saudi Arabia are also quite popular. This is the most convenient option for planning day trips around key cities and moving short and remote distances. Major cities like Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam have standard car rental companies offering a wide range of vehicles to suit every budget. Additionally, Saudi Arabia’s well-maintained highways and roads are relatively straightforward, making self-driving a popular choice.

Most (if not all) travelers in AlUla rent a car to move around more freely, and more experienced travelers can get a vehicle in Madina and travel from this holy city to AlUla on a road trip.

Unlike Oman, where a 4WD vehicle improves the travel experience a lot, you can get in Saudi Arabia a small car for 40-50 EUR per day and make the most of the country.

Read more: What are the best things to do in AlUla

The only way to visit this place in AlUla is by renting a car and traveling there.

Taxis and Ride-Hailing Services (Uber, Careem, and Co.)

Yes, Uber works in Saudi Arabia. This is one of the most convenient apps to move around large cities. Rides may be a bit more expensive than conventional taxis with a taximeter, but the convenience of Uber is simply flawless. Careem is another company that works very well in the Middle East. A ride with Careem may be a bit cheaper than Uber, but this is not always the case – there is for sure more availability.

Taxis in Saudi Arabia also work very well. Unlike countries like Egypt and Jordan, in which you have to negotiate with the driver, in Jeddah or Riyadh, you can simply hail a cab, and the driver will automatically use the taximeter. This is one of the most convenient ways to travel around Saudi Arabia’s cities.

Due to the long distances and non-optimal public transport in Riyadh, Uber was my app to go.

What about hitchhiking in Saudi Arabia?

I have met several travelers who hitchhiked in Saudi Arabia and found it a great adventurous option. Based on my research on travel forums, this was an option for travelers trying to get to Qatar from Saudi Arabia for the World Cup. Other travelers have covered remote parts of Saudi Arabia hitchhiking and have not found any trouble. Saudi Arabia is probably one of the safest countries in the world (for men and women), and you will only encounter friendly people trying their best to help. The only risk is that you gain weight from all the invitations to have dinner with a random family.

NOTE: Crossing borders on foot in Saudi Arabia is forbidden. If you try this, you will be sent back at the first checkpoint.

Despite the description of the country in some news media, I felt in Saudi Arabia extremely welcomed. Everyone spoke very good english and I was able to talk to everyone about everything.

Communication in Saudi Arabia

When it comes to direct communication with locals, Saudi Arabia has a very high index of education. Most people I encountered on my trip spoke perfect English, and those who didn’t were extremely friendly and helpful in whatever I needed.

Additionally, having a connection to the internet at all times was super practical for translating or asking where to go.

For those concern about paper tickets and communication at bus and metro stations, all bookings for busses and trains are possible to do online, and online tickets are the standard in the country.

Read more: How to plan a road trip in Oman

Madina opened for tourism and maybe Mecca might open too in the upcoming years.

When it comes to internet connection on the road, during my first visit in Saudi Arabia, I got a SIM card from Virgin with 20GB for 20 EUR (more or less). This is still the cheapest option for travelers needing high data.

For my second trip, I will use my global plan of Flexiroam and maybe get a local SIM card with Virgin once I settle down in Jeddah.

The most convenient option is to get a country plan with Airalo a few days before traveling. A 10 GB plan costs 25 EUR, but you will get internet right after you land in Saudi Arabia."

Saudi Arabia is known for being a conservative (to put it mildly) nation and a difficult one to visit. The country does not offer a visa for tourism purposes and most of the travelers that the country welcomes visit for religious purposes or work. However, Saudi Arabia is getting ready to open up its hidden gems and cultural treasures to the rest of the world and things are changing.

Travelling to Saudi Arabia- A Guide

Saudi Arabia Tourist Visa & Tourist Developments

https://www.instagram.com/p/BqKj-ElA2Zy/

The country has announced plans to roll out a new visitor visa soon, which is exactly why I’ve decided to write this article. The new electronic visa for Saudi Arabia would be a single entry visa and would allow foreign visitors to enter the country for 30 days.

The Saudi Arabia eVisa is part of a bold plan to boost the number of visitors that travel to the country. The kingdom already welcomes millions of Muslims who make the pilgrimage to Mecca each year. Besides the introduction of an electronic visa system, Saudi Arabia is developing a major theme park, new resorts on the Red Sea Coast and more.

Even though the country is making several changes, there are still several things to be wary of before thinking about a trip to Saudi Arabia. You need to keep in mind their rules, their traditions, and their culture.

Things to be Careful of – Saudia Arabia Travel Tips

https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs2hA1ugQ6d/

The new emphasis on tourism is occurring at a time of change in Saudi Arabia. From granting women the right to drive to allowing female-only gyms, positive changes are happening. The Saudi government announced to end a 35-year ban on cinemas too. Saudi Arabia hopes to attract 30 million visitors by the year 2030, up from 18 million in 2016.

But that doesn’t mean that all the rules are gone. There are still plenty of thing you need to be careful of. If you are thinking about traveling to Saudi Arabia there are a few things you MUST know before booking your trip (once the tourist visa becomes available).

https://www.instagram.com/p/BsTDFHXl0UK/

Couples should be married – at this time obtaining a visa to Saudi Arabia is likely to be a more difficult task if you are unmarried. Travelers of many foreign countries Couples should be married- if you want to travel with your partner to Saudi Arabia you must apply for a visa through an embassy or consulate and requirements are very specific. Unmarried couples may get their visa denied. Hopefully this will become more relaxed in the future. Women travellers must have a sponsor– Saudi Arabia has several cultural and political rules in place. Women traveling alone must be met by a sponsor upon arrival in the country. It is common that your sponsor holds your passport during your stay. Female travel to Saudi Arabia is undeniably difficult and full of barriers that we are not used to in the West.

You can read about a female reporter’s experience in Saudi Arabia Be respectful of the local culture – Women aren’t allowed in public without a male guardian. Beware that public displays of affection are frowned upon and drinking alcohol is a big no. Smoking bans in public places are being enforced more rigorously. Don’t expect nightlife to be the same as in the West – All alcohol, nightclubs, theatres etc are banned in Saudi Arabia. Entertainment at night in the country is about dinner parties or other hosted events. You cannot party late while visiting Saudi Arabia. Often events are separated by gender.



– All alcohol, nightclubs, theatres etc are banned in Saudi Arabia. Entertainment at night in the country is about dinner parties or other hosted events. You cannot party late while visiting Saudi Arabia. Often events are separated by gender. You might need to keep the camera in the bag – most travelers, like myself, today love taking photos of everything they see. However, the government in Saudi Arabia is cautious about tourists using their cameras or phones in public as they can be perceived as espionage or terrorism plotting. When visiting government buildings or other high-traffic locations including mosques and markets be sure to keep your camera out of sight. I think I’d have to think of it as a free digital detox or I’d go mad. Playing music in public is forbidden – if you begin playing music in public it might be perceived as causing public disturbance and could get you in trouble. Once you’re in your hotel you can listen to your tunes, but always keep your neighbors in mind. FINALLY a rule I can get behind. I absolutely hate people playing music one their phones in public places, so I’m all about this rule. Religious items from non-Islamic religions are banned – laws in Saudi Arabia forbids public observance of any religion other than Islam. If you have a crucifix or a Bible or any other religious objects is best to leave them at your hotel. This was also the case in the Maldives, though they didn’t actually check my bags or anything. But yeah, it might be a hard one for anyone with any religious tattoos. You need to dress respectfully. Dress is really important and not just for women. Women cannot expose their arms, legs, and especially the chest area. Exposing your chest may get you serious jail time besides harassment. Men should wear trousers and avoid shorts also so as not to offend. Jeddah and Dammam cities can be a bit more liberal, but it’s still best to abide by the rules. Though the rules have relaxed in recent years an Abaya may still be required to be worn by women in some areas. The Abaya of Saudi Arabia is a black sheet/cape-like garment that covers the body from the neck down.

What to See and Do in Saudi Arabia

https://www.instagram.com/p/BtOb_y_HHsp/

Saudi Arabia welcomes Muslims from all over the world, and only Muslims are allowed to visit La Medina and the Mecca. These two destinations are about religious pilgrimage and non-Muslims are not allowed.

However, there are plenty more tourist places in Saudi Arabia for all to visit:

Riyadh Kingdom Centre Tower – this is an iconic symbol of Saudi Arabia’s capital. It is both a shopping mall and a residential complex. It’s home to an observatory and it rises at over 300 metres. Kingdom Centre is only the third-tallest building in the country. Once the country opens up to tourists it will be a great place to visit and shop and will no doubt become one of the top Saudi Arabia tourist spots.

Empty Quarter or Rub’ al Khali – this destination will surprise you. It is the largest contiguous sand desert in the world. Visitors can visit on a camel safari, drive 4x4s through the dunes or visit with the nomadic tribes that live here. Once visas start being issued this is place is a must, however, you might want to consider traveling with a guide.

Port Jeddah and its coral houses – Jeddah is known for being a more open city and has a more relaxed attitude toward foreign visitors and the dress code. Jeddah offers a one of a kind sight, the “Coral Houses” built out of blocks coral harvested from the sea.

Lost City of Mada’in Saleh – Saudi Arabia is home to a city that dates back to the Nabatean Kingdom of the 1st century. Many Saudis visit Mada’in in Saleh, but it is far from being crowded. You will be able to explore this area in peace.

Diving in the Red Sea – the country has impressive coastlines and has access to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. In terms of Saudi Arabia tourist attractions snorkeling and scuba diving in the Red Sea is one of the highlights. You might want to consider Allah’s Reef and Boiler Wreck. Unlike Egypt, Saudi Arabia does not have large crowds and you’ll be able to appreciate nature’s beauty more calmly. Once the new Red Sea Coast resort area is complete this will be a wonderful area to visa.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BtJbjZhH9YK/

As Saudi Arabia prepares to welcome tourists like never before, it is likely that you will be able to discover a new Saudi Arabia. And though some of their rules, restrictions and practices may seem offensive and upsetting to those of us living in a much more liberal and feminist society, we must welcome the attempt that Saudi Arabia is making at becoming more open.

Personally, I wouldn’t feel comfortable visiting Saudi Arabia as a woman for another couple of years, I think it would be a bit too much culture shock for me. But if you’re the wildly adventurous type then Saudi Arabia could be a great challenge for you when the tourist visa becomes available.

Singapore opposition hit with misinformation law before polls,"SINGAPORE: Singapore’s government has used a controversial online misinformation law to order an opposition party to correct a social media post, days after campaigning got underway for an election next week.

Under the law, ministers can order social media sites to put warnings next to posts the government considers false and order pages be blocked, but critics fear it is being used to suppress dissent.

On Thursday the government ordered Peoples Voice to correct a video posted on Facebook and YouTube and the opposition party complied, putting up banners saying it contains inaccurate information.

In the video, party chief Lim Tean said the government spends a quarter of a billion Singapore dollars ($180 million) “providing free education for foreigners every year.”

A government website aimed at debunking untrue information said the video contained “a false and misleading statement,” as a significant majority of such students have to pay fees higher than local students.

The large number of foreigners in the city-state has become a hot-button issue ahead of the election, with the opposition pressing the government to put Singaporeans first when it comes to job opportunities.

People’s Voice is among a handful of small opposition groups taking on the long-ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) at the July 10 vote.

While the PAP is expected to remain in power, the opposition hopes to win more seats in parliament.

Since the misinformation law came into force last year, several opposition figures and activists have been ordered to correct posts while Facebook has been forced to block pages on several occasions.

The tech giant said last month the use of the law is “severe” and risks stifling free speech, while Google and Twitter have also expressed concerns.

But authorities insist the measure is necessary to stop falsehoods from circulating online that could sow divisions in the multi-ethnic, multi-faith country of 5.7 million."
"Blast in eastern Afghanistan kills top Pakistani militant, Afghan officials say","KABUL/PESHAWAR: A top Pakistani militant, Mangal Bagh, was killed in an explosion in Afghanistan’s eastern Nangarhar province on Thursday, Afghan officials said.

Bagh, 47, was one of the founders of Lashkar-e-Islam, a group that for over a decade remained involved in militant attacks and drug trafficking in Khyber district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan.

For a short period, he was also affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban.

""The leader of Lashkar-e-Islam terrorist group, Mangal Bagh along with his two friends were killed in a mine placed from their side in Achin district ... today before lunch,"" Nangarhar governor Ziaulhaq Amarkhail said in a tweet.

""Mangal Bagh was involved in a series of terroristic activities in the region,"" he added.

Another official from the province told Arab News on condition of anonymity that the landmine that killed Bagh and his associates in Achin district of Nangarhar, where they were hiding, was planted by the militants themselves to prevent capture by security forces.

""They were walking when they run over the mine which they had placed for their own protection in order to block attack for their capture,"" he said.

The source also said that Bagh had been involved in sectarian killings in the Khyber area and his fighters had also attacked convoys carrying US supplies in the past years.

The US in 2018 placed a bounty of $5 million on Bagh’s head.

Malik Riaz Bangash, a Pakistani security analyst based in Peshawar, told Arab News that Bagh's death would be a setback for his criminal outfit and a big news for Pakistan.

""Mangal Bagh death, if confirmed, will be a big news for many because he had his role in different terror activities, including the Army Public School (APS) attack,"" Bangash said.

""I don't think the terror group will be able to find his replacement amongst its cadres because he was the only person known for his terror tactics."""
Game of thrones: Moscow ‘aiding Taliban to undermine US role’,"KABUL: Russia has aided the Taliban for years to force a US withdrawal from Kabul and undermine American influence in the war-ravaged country, a governor and several former Afghan officials told Arab News on Saturday.

Rahmatullah Nabil, director of Afghanistan’s intelligence until 2015, said: “Moscow initiated contact with the Taliban through Iran before 2014, just as Daesh emerged in Afghanistan. Russia believed that the Taliban, unlike Daesh, only had a local agenda and no external ambition.”

He added that Russian engagement with the Taliban began with a “covert meeting in a central Asian country in 2014/2015.”

Nabil’s claims follow news reports last week that allege Moscow offered bounties to the Taliban for the killing of US soldiers in Afghanistan.

The reports, based on US intelligence, were established from intercepted electronic data which showed financial transactions between Russia’s military intelligence agency and a Taliban-linked account. US officials have also named an Afghan contractor who acted as a key middleman in the relationship.

Afghanistan is seen as an important area of Russian foreign policy. Moscow has long regarded Kabul as a key part of its sphere of influence in Central Asia.

Nabil said Russia built ties with the Taliban by investing in key areas and supplying weapons.

“Russia invested in four layers in Afghanistan — high-ranking government officials, politicians, Taliban and local warlords in the north. To the first two categories, it sent financial support through Hawala (a traditional tool for money transfers) through some Afghan businessmen, and a top-up in fuel which was exported to Afghanistan,” he said.

He added that weapons “were given at some borders and crossing points.”

“In 2016, Moscow also handed over 10,000 AK-47s to government forces. Even the government does not know where the rifles are,” he said.

Moscow welcomed the toppling of the Taliban in the 2001 US-led invasion, but over the years it has — like its regional ally Iran — spoken against an extended US presence in the country.

Experts say Russia’s complaints have been long in the making.

It began with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, with Russia accusing the US and other Western countries of supplying weapons to Mujahideen factions who fought against Soviet troops.

Russia was eventually forced to retreat from Kabul after nearly 10 years of bloody occupation, creating a deep mistrust between Moscow and Washington, which eventually lead to Russia aiding the Taliban in its bid to force a US withdrawal.

Ghulam Rabbani Rabbani, a member of Kunduz’s provincial council, said he was “not surprised” to learn that Russia was using the Taliban. He added that Rahmatullah Azizi, an Afghan businessman, had acted as a middleman between the two groups.

“Azizi has disappeared all of a sudden, but the intelligence agency has arrested four people close to him,” Rabbani told Arab News.

Others said the war in Afghanistan had both “regional and international dimensions,” and that Russia was just one of the players in the “great game.”

“The war here is not between the government and the Taliban, otherwise you would have already seen a winner,” Dawlat Waziri, a retired defense ministry general, told Arab News, adding that Moscow was tending to old wounds.

“Russia wants the US to suffer a defeat like it did. It wants America to lose soldiers and see the downfall of its economy so that it is forced to leave Afghanistan,” he said.

Anwar Jigdalak, a former governor of Kunduz province, agreed.

Citing locals in northern Kunduz, 335 km north of Kabul, he said the Taliban had once sent one of its shadow governors, Mawlavi Abdul Salaam, to Tajikistan to hold talks with Russian officials and strengthen their relationship.

Kunduz is a strategic province which lies close to Tajikistan, and was the first city seized by the Taliban in 2015 “with the help of Russian intelligence,” Jigdalak said.

“But when Salaam returned to Afghanistan, an American killed him in an air strike. When Moscow wants to be present in Syria, which is very far, why not have influence in Afghanistan which is close,” he added, referring in part to the Russian support of Syria’s Assad regime.

Experts say other issues are at stake, too.

Aimal Faizi, an analyst, said the allegations of Russian bounties are “part of an effort by some to keep troops in Afghanistan.”

He tweeted: “They have been trying to prolong the US war and occupation in Afghanistan by different means.”

Both Moscow and the Taliban have repeatedly denied the allegations. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told Arab News on Thursday that the reports were “false,” and spread “to keep US troops in Afghanistan to confront its enemies.”

He added: “Our contacts with Russia have been all the time for political and diplomatic goals only.”

Last week’s report comes amid a push by several current and former US generals to keep US troops in Afghanistan, an important condition for a historic peace deal signed with the Taliban in late February this year.

If it happens, it could throw the spotlight on President Donald Trump’s campaign pledge to withdraw all troops from the country.

Trump, who is standing for re-election in November, said all soldiers would leave by next spring based on the February agreement."
Saudi Arabia helps Yemenis fight malnutrition,"JEDDAH: The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSrelief) on Saturday continued to implement its project to ensure basic health services in public schools and fight malnutrition among students and educational staff in Yemen’s Aden governorate.

When the UK turned the heat on China with its surprise announcement that it was ending Huawei’s involvement in Britain’s 5G network infrastructure, followed by a suspension of Britain’s extradition treaty with Hong Kong, it was clear that these actions had as much to do with London’s relations with Washington as with Beijing.

There may be good reasons to confront, or at least be cautious about, China’s intentions in its drive to become a leader in the 5G world, and critical of the methods it is applying to achieve this; and there are most definitely legitimate concerns about China’s human rights record and its abysmal behaviour toward the people of Hong Kong in violation of the 1984 Sino–British Joint Declaration that set the terms of British withdrawal from the colony and its return to China in 1997.

Nevertheless, the timing of Britain’s actions, under American duress, raises concerns that this is bringing the world a step closer to a new Cold War, in which the UK is not necessarily asserting its own position and interests, let alone values, but is being dragged into for fear of the Trump administration’s Sinophobic rage and to guard transatlantic relations. Its pursuit of the Brexit folly has exposed the UK’s vulnerability to US pressure and to Chinese retaliatory measures.

According to the Observer newspaper, the UK government privately admitted to Huawei’s representatives that it was ending their company’s involvement in Britain’s 5G network not only because of genuine security concerns, but to a large extent for “geopolitical” reasons, or in other words, massive pressure by President Trump. To increase that pressure, a delegation of senior White House officials flew to London to present the government with allegedly fresh technical evidence to back their claims of security risks posed by Huawei and to demand a full British 5G ban on Huawei.

What gives credibility to assertions of American pressure rather than any reassessment of the risk of Huawei conducting wholesale surveillance in the UK is that as recently as late January the government decided to allow Huawei’s involvement in the super-fast 5G network, with certain exclusions and limitations regarding core functions, as was recommended by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre.

The importance of cyber security in an age when so much activity is conducted in and depends on cyberspace is in no doubt, as is ensuring that all sensitive information regarding national security and the private lives of individuals is guarded. But the commercial world as well as governments have long been hacking into each other’s networks and invading the privacy of internet users, and China is far from being the only culprit.

It is the timing, the haste and the sudden change of heart that makes one skeptical about the motives of the British government and its readiness to risk the wrath of Beijing, which will probably come in the form of punitive economic measures. After all, the UK is aligning itself late with the other Five Eyes intelligence-sharing nations in banning Huawei from its 5G network.

Equally, the current phase of Beijing’s attack on Hong Kong’s “one country two systems” agreement began more than a year ago, when a bill was introduced in June 2019 allowing extradition to mainland China. Beijing’s response to the protests against the bill left no doubt that this was another step toward abolishing any exceptionalism for the former British colony and curtailing the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong while using excessive force against protesters and locking up their leaders. But neither the UK nor the US did much to support the rights of the people of Hong Kong until it suited their wider interest of confronting China.

On both counts Boris Johnson’s government could have developed its own specific and targeted policies while distancing itself from Trump’s all-out confrontation with China, which is more about the president’s biases, prejudices and nationalist populism that threaten to drag the US, its allies and the rest of world into a new Cold War in which there are unlikely to be any winners.

Unlike the previous Cold War with its deep ideological undercurrents and nuclear cloud hanging above it, the present one is becoming an aggressive contest with no clear objectives, fueled by bellicose demagoguery originating from the Trump administration’s inclination to blame China for all the world’s ills, including the coronavirus pandemic, described by the US president as the “Chinese virus” while propagating the “theory” that it was started in a Chinese laboratory, despite his own intelligence agencies not supporting this accusation. In the Trump mindset, at a time when almost everything is going horribly wrong for him and with less than four months before the presidential elections, aggravating relations with China is his wild card aimed at rallying the nationalist base and creating a false sense of him as a world leader containing China’s hegemonic aspirations, while leaning on allies to pursue similar policies.

Instead of employing a mix of assertiveness, pragmatism and caution, the US is leading the march, now with the support of the UK, toward a full-on clash with Beijing, while being inconsistent on both trade and human rights issues. Both countries should ask themselves why they haven’t built the capacity to preclude any reliance on Huawei to construct their 5G networks, and by such neglect exposed their technological vulnerability and inability to advance their democratic values.

China’s treatment of Hong Kong, Tibet or the Uighur people deserves condemnation and a powerful response, and protecting intellectual property and network security are issues of national interest. But what we are witnessing right now is an escalation of hostilities with a resurgent and confident China, rather than any principled position on human rights, or pragmatic one on trade relations being taken. It is a lose-lose scenario which is likely to serve only Trump’s electioneering needs, and in which the UK is proving itself to be no more than a weak tag-along.

Suspected Boko Haram extremists kill at least 40 farmers in Nigeria,"MAIDGURI, Nigeria: Suspected members of the militant group Boko Haram killed at least 40 rice farmers and fishermen while they were harvesting crops in Nigeria’s northern Borno State, officials said.

The attack was staged Saturday in a rice field in Garin Kwashebe, a Borno community known for rice farming, on the day residents of the state were casting votes for the first time in 13 years to elect local government councils, though many didn’t go to cast their ballots.

The farmers were reportedly rounded up and summarily killed by armed insurgents.

Malam Zabarmari, a leader of a rice farmers association in Borno state, confirmed the massacre.

“The farmers were attacked at the Garin-Kwashebe rice field in Zabarmari community, and according to reports reaching us since afternoon, about 40 of them were killed,” he said, adding that it likely could be up to 60 people killed.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari expressed grief over the killings.

“I condemn the killing of our hardworking farmers by terrorists in Borno State. The entire country is hurt by these senseless killings. My thoughts are with their families in this time of grief. May their souls Rest In Peace,” he said in a statement.

Buhari said the government had given all the needed support to the armed forces “to take all necessary steps to protect the country’s population and its territory.”

A member of the House of Representatives, Ahmed Satomi, who represents the Jere Federal constituency of Borno, said at least 44 burials will take place Sunday.

“Farmers and fishermen were killed in cold blood. Over 60 farmers were affected, but we only have so far received 44 corpses from the farms and we are preparing for their burials today, Sunday by God’s grace,” the federal lawmaker said.

Boko Haram and a breakaway faction, the Islamic State West Africa Province, are both active in the region. Boko Haram’s more than decade-long insurgency has left thousands dead and displaced tens of thousands. Officials say Boko Haram members often force villagers to pay illegal taxes by taking their livestock or crops. But over time, some villagers have begun to resist the extortion.

Satomi said the farmers in Garin Kwashebe were attacked because they had disarmed and arrested a Boko Haram gunman on Friday who had been tormenting them.

“A lone gunman, who was a member of Boko Haram came to harass the farmers by ordering them to give him money and also cook for him. While he was waiting for the food to be cooked, the farmers seized the moment he stepped into the toilet to snatch his rifle and tied him up,” he said.

“They later handed him over to the security. But sadly, the security forces did not protect the courageous farmer. And in reprisal for daring them, the Boko Haram mobilized and came to attack them on their farms.”

Insurgents also torched the rice farms before leaving, he said."
TWITTER POLL: Two-thirds say they won’t volunteer for COVID-19 vaccine,"DUBAI: Nearly two-thirds of respondents to an Arab News Twitter poll said they would not be willing to take part in a coronavirus vaccine trial.

Of the 949 people who took part nearly 61 percent said they would not be willing to join a vaccine trial, while nearly 40 percent said they would.

Laboratories around the world are in a race to be the first to discover a formula that will cure the virus that has claimed up to 880,000 lives, while infecting millions more.

The discovery of a cure, or vaccine to protect us from the virus, would likely be worth millions to the country and company that creates it.

But many people are wary to take part in such trials as part of the process often involves being infected with the disease that is being researched."
