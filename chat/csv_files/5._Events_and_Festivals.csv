2024 Year in Review: The events that testified to Saudi Arabia’s transformation,"LONDON: In 1924, Riyadh was a small oasis town, covering less than one square kilometer and home to no more than 30,000 people.

One hundred years ago, the motor car had yet to displace the camel as the primary form of transport and the future capital of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was still contained within the defensive walls that had encircled it for 200 years.

Today, Riyadh is a vast metropolis, the largest city on the Arabian Peninsula. Ever expanding, the capital is currently spread over 1,500 square kilometers and has a population close to eight million, largely reliant on the car.

In 2024, however, Riyadh took a significant step toward an increasingly sustainable future with the opening on Dec. 1 of the first three lines of a revolutionary new driverless metro system linking all parts of the city over 176 km of tracks.

Riyadh’s goal is not only to get bigger, but also to get better, leading the nation in following the blueprint of Vision 2030, the plan to transition the Kingdom away from an oil-dependent economy — and the new mass-transit system will relieve pressure on the roads by removing tens of millions of car journeys every year.

A decade in the making, by the end of January 2025 all six metro lines are expected to be open, with 190 trains serving 85 stations, initially carrying 1.2 million passengers a day and with a planned capacity of 3.6 million.

Treasured traces of the city’s past remain. Line 1, the Blue Line, which serves the north-south axis of the capital, passes close by the old town, where Al-Masmak Fort, once the largest building in Riyadh, dating back to the 19th century and recaptured by Abdulaziz Al-Saud in 1902, still stands in testimony to the Kingdom’s past.

As Riyadh has grown and changed, so too has the whole of Saudi Arabia, and 2024 has seen a host of events that together bear witness to just how rapidly the Kingdom is evolving, transforming itself into a global player and destination in the process.

The year in Saudi Arabia began as it is ending, with the Winter at Tantora Festival, the culture, art and music festival at AlUla, which this year started on Dec. 19 and continues until Jan. 11.

From its beginnings in December 2018, when the festival featured the Italian singer Andrea Bocelli and the French violinist Renaud Capucon, it has grown to become a globally recognized celebration of art, music, and culture, with many events taking place in the stunning mirror-walled Maraya concert hall in AlUla’s Ashar Valley.

An early highlight in the 2024 season was the classical concert on Dec. 27 by singer Abeer Nehme and The National Arab Orchestra, which celebrated the rich tapestry of Arab heritage.

At the other end of the musical scale in 2024 was MDLBEAST Soundstorm, the mid-December music festival which, with some justification, lays claim to being “the loudest weekend in Riyadh,” and this year featured acts including Eminem, Muse, David Guetta and Linkin Park.

Another mass-participation cultural event that is increasingly putting Saudi Arabia on the global entertainment map is Riyadh Season, a high-octane, multi-venue, six-month celebration that is billed as the biggest and most diverse entertainment festival in the world.

Starting on Oct. 12 in 2024, within two months the season had attracted more than 10 million visitors.

One highlight this year was the bout in the Kingdom Arena between light-heavyweight boxing champions Dmitry Bivol and Artur Beterbiev, won by the Russian Beterbiev, who became the first undisputed four-belt light-heavyweight champion since 2002.

By way of contrast, and summing up the eclectic diversity of the entire season, on Nov. 14 stars flew into Riyadh from around the world for the 45th anniversary celebration of Lebanese couturier Elie Saab.

The fashion show was attended by celebrities including Jennifer Lopez, Halle Berry, Celine Dion, Nadine Nassib Njeim, Monica Bellucci and Razane Jammal.

Over on the west coast in Jeddah, the fourth iteration of the Red Sea International Film Festival, which ran from Dec. 5 to 14, continued to reinforce its reputation as a rapidly emerging force in the global film industry.

Championing films from Saudi Arabia and the Arab world, Asia, and Africa, the festival featured conversations with global stars including Sarah Jessica Parker and Priyanka Chopra.

On the sporting front, this year the Kingdom added another sport to a rapidly growing portfolio that already embraces soccer, golf, boxing and Formula One. This year’s Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, the second round of the F1 championship, was the fourth in the country and was won by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.

In November, the Women’s Tennis Association finals were held in Riyadh for the first time, with a record $15 million prize purse on offer.

The final saw world No. 3 Coco Gauff beat Zheng Qinwen in what is slated to be the first of several such finals to be held in the Kingdom.

After her victory against the Chinese Olympic champion, the 20-year-old American praised the event as inspirational for young Saudis, “just to show young girls that, you know, their dreams are possible,” she said.

She added: “I’m literally no different than they are. We just maybe come from different places.”

By the time she retired, she said, she hoped there would be a Saudi Grand Slam champion.

But perhaps the biggest moment in Saudi Arabia’s 2024 came on Dec. 11, when global footballing body FIFA confirmed that the 2034 World Cup would be held in the Kingdom.

Hosting the 48-team tournament in 15 stadiums across five cities will bring in hundreds of thousands of fans and players, many of whom will be experiencing the Kingdom in person for the first time.

“For us, soccer or football is not only a sport,” Saudi Sports Minister Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said after the news was announced, “it is a value that we share with the entire world.”

Saudi Arabia, he added, was “looking forward to hosting” many more events and making football history.

“This is the chance to invite you all to visit my country, to celebrate our culture, to see the greatest success story with your own eyes.”

Fun and games isn’t the only stage on which Saudi Arabia is opening up to the world.

In 2024 the Kingdom hosted a number of high-level global conferences, including biodiversity conference COP16 over the first two weeks in December, at which global pledges to combat drought and land degradation topped $10 billion and, in April, the World Economic Forum’s Special Meeting on Global Collaboration, Growth and Energy for Development."

21 Saudi Arabian megaprojects transforming the Kingdom,"An oil rig hotel, the world’s tallest skyscraper, and a zero-carbon emission city, anyone? We dare you not to be impressed.

Thanks to His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Saudi Vision 2030, which aims to put the country on the tourism map, the kingdom is home to some of the region’s most impressive developments and Saudi Arabian megaprojects are creating blockbuster headlines.

Saudi Arabia is the James Cameron of megaprojects, as Middle East ambition meets blockbuster scale. If you want proof of how grand these plans are, these are not called megaprojects but gigaprojects. So we’re not just looking at millionaire-dollar developments, but billionaire-dollar ones.

We’re talking about UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the world’s longest skyscraper and cities rising from the sand. These are not just any cities, but sustainable, sci-fi-like ones – flying taxis, anyone?

Hop on board and bring your imagination along. Here are the most exciting Saudi Arabian megaprojects.

Al Widyan

Dubbed a city within a city, Al Widyan is located north of Riyadh. It covers seven million square metres and will be divided into 12 districts. Aiming to be the cool, cosmopolitan part of the capital, it will encompass entertainment, education, and leisure facilities, plus 20,000 new homes. Best of all, more than half of the development will be home to a park—we’re talking wadis and walkways.

Amaala

Located between Neom and The Red Sea, Amaala promises to be an all-year-round family wellness destination that forms part of Saudi Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the economy. The destination is spread across three sites in Prince Mohammed bin Salmon Natural Reserve and spans a whopping 4,155 square kilometres. It is no surprise that it draws its inspiration from the nearby Red Sea. So, we’re excited to hear that it will boast a marine life institute, yacht club, 3,000 hotel rooms, residences and state-of-the-art recreational facilities. Amaala encompasses three sub-projects: Triple Bay, The Coastal Development and The Island.

Aseer Development Project

Announced in 2021, the Aseer Development Project is one of the most recent Saudi Arabian megaprojects. Aseer is best known for its glorious mountains. Plus, it is home to historical sights including Rijal Almaa village, Jaresh archaeological site, and the Heritage House in Al Namas. Plus, in the summer, it hosts the Abha Summer Festival.

The Aseer Development Project aims to put Aseer on the tourist map for local and international visitors. The project is named The Arabian Highland, a nod to the area’s mountainous landscape. Its aim is to create tourist attractions at the peak of those mountains so that Aseer will become a must-visit destination all year round.

Diriyah Gate

Diriyah is famous for being the original capital of Saudi Arabia. It is located 14 minutes north of Riyadh and was once the seat of power for the Al Saud family. During the 18th and 19th centuries, it became a politically important site and was home to Mohammed bin Saud, the founder of the first Saudi state.

Today, this Saudi Arabian megaproject combines the past and future. The area is being transformed into a buzzing tourist destination. Built to be sustainable, it aims to attract 100,000 residents and 25 million visitors annually. As a cultural hotspot, it will be home to shops, restaurants, and hotels, including Anantara Diriyah, Armani Hotel Diriyah, and LXR Hotels & Resorts.

Diriyah is also home to the UNESCO World Heritage Site Al Turaif, which gives visitors an insight into the kingdom’s history. Additionally, Diriyah Season takes place each year, bringing together world-class entertainment, sports, and restaurants.

Jeddah Central Project

Ask any Saudi what the arty capital of the kingdom is, and chances are they’ll say Jeddah. The city’s culture is about to get an upgrade when the Jeddah Central Project is completed. This $20 billion Saudi Arabian megaproject will bring an opera house, sports stadium, museum, and oceanarium to the city. Expected to be completed by 2027, it will also include hotels, homes, beach resorts, and a marina boasting restaurants, cafes, and shops.

Jabal Omar

A hotel within walking distance of the Grand Mosque? Well, you’re in luck as Jabal Omar is a major development in the heart of Mecca. The project aims to increase the capacity of visitors during Hajj, as it will include hotel and residential buildings that are close to the Grand Mosque.

When completed, an additional 100,000 people will be able to visit during Hajj. South-East Asian company Archipelago International is creating luxury hotels, including Jabal Omar, The Royal Alana Makkah and Jabal Omar, The Alana Makkah.

Jeddah Economic City

Watch out Burj Khalifa. Jeddah continues its expansion with Jeddah Economic City, a new development that will boast homes, hotels, offices and the world’s tallest building. Located between Mecca and Madinah, this is one of the most impressive Saudi Arabian megaprojects, spanning 5.3 million square meters. Jeddah Economic City’s crowning glory will be Jeddah Tower. When completed, the structure will be 1 kilometre high and the world’s tallest building. Plus, it will contain the world’s highest observation deck, apartments, shopping malls and gourmet restaurants.

Jeddah Metro

While much has been written about Riyadh Metro, it’s not just the capital getting a new transport system. Plans for Jeddah Metro were approved in 2013, and it is projected to cost $60 billion. Jeddah Metro is expected to be completed by 2025, and it currently has three lines under development. The metro will be crucial in linking King Abdulaziz International Airport to Prince Abdullah Al-Faisal Stadium. Plus, we are expecting it to look slick, as it is being designed by British architecture firm, Foster + Partners.

Jeddah Waterfront Project

The new Saudi Arabian megaproject is part of the Jeddah Historical Rejuvenation Project, which was launched in 2021 by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Jeddah’s Waterfront Project is currently projected to take two years. The plan is to reconnect Al Balad with the Red Sea. Upon completion, it aims to revitalise the historic Al Bunt Port and transform the Al Balad area into a tourist destination. In phase one of Jeddah’s Waterfront Project, the waterfront section that was once filled will be carved out. In phase two, Lake Al Arbaeen’s water will be treated and purified. Finally, phase three will see the creation of a marina for luxury yachts, green spaces, pedestrian overpasses and public utilities.

King Abdullah Financial District

King Abdullah Financial District, aka KAFD, is one of the Saudi Arabian megaprojects currently underway in Riyadh. The 1.6 million-square-meter regeneration project will create homes, work spaces, and entertainment spaces. When completed, it will be able to accommodate 50,000 residents. Plus, commuters will be happy, as the KAFD metro station will be on their doorstep. With world-famous design firms on board, such as Omrania and Foster + Partners (again), we expect this to be an architectural wonder.

King Salman Park

If you thought New York’s Central Park was massive, think again. Riyadh’s King Salman Park will be four times the size and stretch an impressive 13.4 square kilometres. Covering where the capital’s airport once was, it aims to make the transport hub the lungs of the capital.

The lush oasis will be more than just a park. Sure, there’ll be vertical gardens, wadis and walkways. There’ll also be a butterfly conservatory, outdoor art exhibitions, an open-air theatre, cinemas, museums and sports facilities ranging from a golf course to an equestrian centre. Plus, the area will include hotels, homes, restaurants and shops.

Konoz Box of Treasures

The Saudi capital is set to grow once more, with Abdullah Al-Othaim Investment Company revealing plans for an entertainment complex in Riyadh. The name “Konoz” translates to “box of treasures,” with a range of precious gemstones serving as a source of inspiration for the development’s visual and architectural elements across its various zones.

The Konoz Box of Treasures development comprises a 20,000 sqm entertainment city and 50,000 sqm of modern commercial office spaces. The entertainment city is designed to enhance the city’s tourism and leisure offerings, while the office spaces will provide cutting-edge facilities to support Riyadh’s business community. The development will also feature retail and F&B outlets, a 250-room hotel, 120 serviced apartments and a residential complex.

Marafy

Say hello to Jeddah’s new Chicago-sized waterfront destination. Marafy is a groundbreaking concept anchored around a show-stopping feature – an 11-km-long and 100-metre-wide canal.

Neom

Saudi Arabian megaprojects don’t get more sci-fi than Neom. The name itself is a combination of the Greek words for new and the Arabic word for future. Neom will be the size of Belgium and sit north of the Red Sea coastline. The development sounds like one of the world’s most futuristic cities, as it plans to have flying taxis and glow-in-the-dark beaches.

Other projects at Neom include Oxagan and The Line. Oxagon aims to be the world’s largest floating industrial complex, while The Line aims to be a 170-kilometer-long residential complex with zero cars, streets, and carbon emissions. If that wasn’t impressive enough, The Line plans to build the world’s longest skyscraper: Mirror Line. The structure will be a record-breaking 121 kilometres long and comprises two buildings up to 490 metres tall.

New Murabba

We love Saudi Arabia’s capital, but it’s about to get a little more exciting. His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz has announced the latest in a long line of Saudi Arabian megaprojects, New Murabba. The $800 billion project aims to double the size and population of the capital and transform downtown Riyadh. Upon completion, the new megaproject will make the city more of a cultural hotspot. The site will include a museum, technology and design university, multi-purpose immersive theatre and more than 80 cultural and entertainment venues.

Qiddiya

Qiddiya will be the Disneyland of Saudi Arabia. Located in the southwest of the country, the family-friendly destination will be packed with entertainment aplenty. We’re talking water parks and theme parks, including Six Flags Qiddiya, which has the world’s tallest, fastest, and longest roller coaster. Sports activities include a golf course, aquatic centre, stadium, and karting facilities. Art activities include a performing arts centre, multiplex cinema, and festival grounds.

Rua Al Madinah

The Rua Al Madinah megaproject encompasses an extensive master plan spanning over 1.5 million square metres of space, providing direct views of the Prophet’s Mosque. Its design also ensures a blend of aesthetics and functionality, with 63 per cent dedicated to open areas and 37 per cent thoughtfully allocated to structures. To enhance accessibility, the project boasts several transportation solutions, including nine strategically placed bus stops catering to visitors’ convenience and underground parking to keep the surroundings pristine.

We know that the project will feature 11 new hotels: Aloft Rua Al Madinah, Courtyard by Marriott Rua Al Madinah, Fairmont Rua Al Madinah, Four Points by Sheraton Rua Al Madinah, JW Marriott Rua Al Madinah, Le Méridien Rua Al Madinah, Madinah Marriott Hotel Rua Al Madinah, Novotel Rua Al Madinah, Swissôtel Rua Al Madinah and The Ritz-Carlton, Rua Al Madinah.

Sharaan Nature Reserve

Thanks to the recent work, Arabian wolves and red foxes have already been spotted on the land.

Sharaan Nature Reserve will also be home to a luxury retreat, which is expected to be completed by 2023. Plus, French architect Jean Nouvel, who is behind the Louvre Abu Dhabi, will create the world’s first resort hidden within rocks, which is expected to be completed by 2030.

The North Pole sounds like something straight out of a science fiction film, as it will feature air taxis and vertical living. The urban living space will create homes as well as offices. The state-of-the-art transport system will include autonomous vehicles and high-speed underground transport. The site will also include bike lanes, pathways, pedestrian-friendly streets and access to nature. Plus, it will boast green credentials and be powered by solar energy as well as renewable sources.

The Red Sea Project

Say the words “Red Sea,” and you’ll probably imagine it miraculously parted for Moses. The Red Sea Project is fittingly epic in scale, as it is one of the most ambitious regenerative tourism projects the world has ever seen. Located in Tabuk province, it is between the cities of Umluj and Al Wakh.

The Saudi Arabian megaproject is expected to cover 28,000 kilometres of islands, beaches, deserts, mountains and even volcanos and be a leading destination for eco-luxury. The plan is to have no waste-to-landfill or single-use plastic and be 100 per cent carbon neutral.

With The Red Sea International Airport in the works, the first phase is expected to open in 2023. Hotels are flocking to The Red Sea Project. Hyatt Hotels plans to grow its portfolio in the kingdom with Miraval The Red Sea, and Grand Hyatt The Red Sea. Plus, Faena Red Sea Resort will be located on Shura Island in the Red Sea.

The project is forecast to increase Saudi Arabia’s GDP by $5.86 billion per year and attract one million visitors annually, making it one of the kingdom’s biggest earners.

The Rig

Thrill seekers, this one’s for you. An oil rig might not sound like your conventional holiday, but it will definitely be a break you’ll remember. Located on Saudi Arabia’s east coast, The Rig is just that – an oil rig.

At 150,000 square metres, it is the world’s biggest offshore multipurpose structure. Guests will need to travel to the venue by ferry, yacht, or helicopter. Don’t worry—it has its own helipad.

Trojena

Trojena will be one of the most impressive Saudi Arabian megaprojects. It is a destination that blends natural and developed landscapes and will also host the Asian Winter Games 2029. The new supercity will house six distinctive districts centred around tailored experiences that blend real and virtual architectural and engineering innovations.

But first, let’s take a look at why is Madinah an important city in Islam.













Importance of Madinah in Islamic History

Madinah holds immense importance in Islamic history for several reasons:

After facing persecution in Makkah, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) migrated to Madinah. This event marked the beginning of the Muslim community (Ummah).

Madinah has always and will always provide a haven for Muslims to practise their faith freely.

The Prophet's Mosque (Masjid An-Nabawi) was built in Madinah under the guidance of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) himself.

Initially, Muslims faced Jerusalem during prayer (Qibla). However, a revelation received by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in Madinah directed Muslims to face the Kaaba in Makkah.

Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is buried within the Prophet's Mosque, making it a pilgrimage destination for Muslims worldwide.

There is no doubt that Madinah is among the most important cities in Islam, so a guide to its best activities is surely needed.













Top Activities in Madinah you must visit

Masjid Al-Qiblatain is one of the earliest mosques in Madinah. Originally, it had two Mihrabs (prayer niches) facing Jerusalem and Makkah, reflecting the change in Qibla.

Hajj groups, often called convoys, can register through the Nusuk Hajj platform. This establishes their presence in the system. Registered convoys can then electronically issue Hajj permits to their members. These permits serve as official documentation for each pilgrim undertaking Hajj.

The AlUla Tantora Festival, also known as Winter at Tantora, is an exceptional cultural event set against the awe-inspiring backdrop of AlUla, one of Saudi Arabia’s most historically rich and visually stunning regions. AlUla, renowned for its striking sandstone cliffs, lush oases, and ancient Nabataean city of Hegra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, becomes a hub of culture, art, and entertainment from December to March each year.

In Saudi Arabia, the word Tantora refers to an ancient sundial used by the people of AlUla. It was historically employed by the local community to mark the passage of time and, most importantly, to signal the start of the winter planting season. The Tantora was a significant tool for the people of the region, helping them manage agricultural activities based on the position of the sun.

For the adventurous, activities such as hot air balloon rides over the rugged desert terrain or desert polo matches, which blend elegance and tradition, are an exhilarating way to experience the beauty of AlUla.

The festival also transforms the expansive landscapes of AlUla into an open-air gallery, featuring interactive art installations that blend ancient heritage with contemporary creativity. These installations invite visitors to engage with art in a way that feels both immersive and transformative, further highlighting AlUla’s role as a hub for cultural expression.

6. Eid al-Fitr

Eid al-Fitr is one of the most significant Islamic holidays in Saudi Arabia, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, a period of fasting, prayer, and reflection. After a month of abstaining from food and drink from dawn until sunset, Muslims around the country celebrate Eid al-Fitr as a joyous occasion filled with family gatherings, charity, and gratitude.

Photo: STA

The day begins with Salat al-Eid, a special prayer that takes place in mosques and large open areas. These prayers are an essential part of the Eid tradition, bringing communities together in spiritual unity. Following the prayer, families visit the graves of loved ones to offer prayers, reflecting on life’s blessings and the importance of faith.

Eid al-Fitr celebrations in Saudi Arabia typically last for three days, and during this time, the focus is on spending time with family, sharing meals, and exchanging gifts. Traditional Saudi dishes like Kabsa and Ma’amoul (date-filled pastries) are enjoyed as families come together to break their fasts in festive meals. It’s also common for children to receive Eidiya, a gift of money or sweets, as a token of joy.

The streets of Saudi cities and towns come alive during Eid al-Fitr. Homes are decorated, and local markets are bustling as people prepare for the festivities. Many head to shopping malls and parks, where special events and activities are organized for families. Saudi cities light up with a festive atmosphere, from fireworks displays to cultural performances, creating a sense of joy and celebration throughout the country.

An essential part of Eid al-Fitr is Zakat al-Fitr, a form of charity given to those in need before the Eid prayer. This act of charity ensures that even the less fortunate can participate in the celebrations, embodying the spirit of generosity and community that defines the holiday.

Eid al-Fitr in Saudi Arabia is more than just the end of Ramadan—it’s a time of reflection, family unity, and spreading joy. The holiday brings people together, strengthens bonds, and serves as a reminder of the values of faith, gratitude, and charity in everyday life.

7. Eid al-Adha

Eid al-Adha, or the Festival of Sacrifice, is one of the most important holidays in the Islamic calendar, celebrated with deep religious significance across Saudi Arabia. This special holiday coincides with the final days of the Hajj pilgrimage, when millions of Muslims gather in Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, to perform one of the Five Pillars of Islam.

Photo: STA

At the heart of Eid al-Adha is the commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son in obedience to God. In recognition of his faith, God provided a ram to be sacrificed instead, and this act of devotion is remembered today through the practice of Qurbani, or the ritual animal sacrifice. Families across Saudi Arabia participate by sacrificing a sheep, goat, cow, or camel, depending on their means, to honor this tradition.

The sacrificial animal is not only a religious symbol but also an expression of generosity. The meat is divided into three parts: one for the family, one for relatives and friends, and the third is donated to the poor and those in need. This act of sharing underscores the values of community and charity that are central to the Eid al-Adha celebrations.

In Saudi Arabia, Eid al-Adha is a time for festive gatherings, prayer, and reflection. Families come together to enjoy meals prepared from the sacrificed meat, with traditional dishes like Kabsa (spiced rice and meat) and Margoog (a hearty stew) taking center stage at the dinner table. The day begins with Eid prayers, where communities gather at mosques for a special sermon, followed by visits to loved ones and the exchange of gifts.

The streets and markets are alive with activity in the days leading up to Eid al-Adha, as people prepare for the festivities. Markets are full of people purchasing livestock, new clothes, and gifts, while butchers are busy with the sacrificial preparations. It’s a vibrant time that showcases the spirit of togetherness and the importance of helping those less fortunate.

Because Eid al-Adha is closely tied to the Hajj pilgrimage, its significance is even more profound in Saudi Arabia. Many families welcome back loved ones who have completed the Hajj, and there’s a special sense of unity and gratitude as pilgrims reflect on their spiritual journey.

Highlights:

Qurbani : The ritual animal sacrifice, with the meat distributed among family, friends, and the poor.

8. Souk Okaz Festival

The Souk Okaz Festival transports the visitor back to the golden age of Arab civilisation, immersing them in a recreated historic marketplace that once served as a vibrant hub for trade, poetry, and diplomacy.

Held annually in Taif, this festival celebrates the legacy of one of the most famous marketplaces in pre-Islamic Arabia, where tribes from across the Arabian Peninsula would gather to trade goods, share ideas, and showcase their artistic and intellectual talents.

At Souk Okaz, visitors are treated to live poetry readings, a tribute to the souk’s historical role as a centre for literary and cultural exchange. Renowned poets from across the Arab world compete in traditional poetry contests, delivering verses that capture the spirit of the era. These performances connect modern audiences with the eloquence and wit that once flourished in the original souk.

The festival also offers a window into traditional Bedouin life through captivating re-enactments and demonstrations of ancient trades. Visitors can watch leatherworkers craft intricate items by hand, observe metal forgers as they shape tools and ornaments using age-old techniques, and witness potters and weavers create artisanal pieces reminiscent of those that would have been sold in the original marketplace.

Discover Jeddah brings the city’s soul to life,"JEDDAH: Jeddah has long been the gateway to the Kingdom, playing a pivotal role in the nation’s economy through its historic ties to commerce and its unique position as a hub for religious tourism, primarily Umrah and Hajj.

With the launch of Vision 2030, the city was destined to be at the forefront of the National Transformation Program, which elevates the tourism sector and establishes an ecosystem capable of welcoming 100 million tourists annually.

In a stroke of serendipity, Discover Jeddah was founded in 2017 — the same year the program’s execution began. Today, the tourism startup is not just encouraging local and international tourists to visit Saudi Arabia, but to discover Jeddah, the Kingdom’s vibrant coastal hub.

The concept is pretty simple: it is all about telling the story of the “Bride of the Red Sea,” said Ali Almenaie, the CEO of the project with roots in Jeddah, where he was born and raised.







Ali Almenaie, Discover Jeddah founder



He told Arab News: “With too much information out there, I felt that there was a need to show Jeddah through the eyes of those who love it, so that those who have not visited Jeddah or those who have but did not experience the heart and soul of the city, fall in love with it.”

As demand for authentic experiences grew, Almenaie pursued certification from the Ministry of Tourism to become a registered tour guide.

In 2023, he launched Discover Al-Balad, a tour service offering an immersive experience of one of Saudi Arabia’s World Heritage Sites.

On Instagram, Almenaie has curated a visual love letter to Jeddah and Al-Balad, capturing people’s interest, sparking their curiosity and encouraging more people to visit.

I felt that there was a need to show Jeddah through the eyes of those who love it, so that those who have not visited Jeddah or those who have but did not experience the heart and soul of the city, fall in love with it. Ali Almenaie, Discover Jeddah founder

“From a young age I found myself drawn to the art of curation, capturing and collecting images that resonated with the things I cherished most in life,” Almenaie explained.

“I was captivated by the power of visuals to tell a story. This love for storytelling naturally extended to Jeddah, the city of my heart. I began to gather images that could capture its essence, hoping to piece together a narrative that was both personal and profound.”

Almenaie added that he felt there was “a glaring absence, a silence where there should have been a vibrant, visual tale of Jeddah.”

He said: “The city’s story was out there, waiting to be told, but it was missing the richness that only images could convey. I realized that what was lacking was a visual narrative — one that could bring to life the soul of Jeddah, beyond words, in a way that was immediate and impactful.”







Kholoud Abdulwassie, tour guide.



In addition to guided tours, Discover Jeddah offers advertising services that include storytelling about significant locations in Jeddah.

It also offers multilingual tours to ensure that everyone can easily appreciate the city’s significance and its heritage sites. It also suggests optimal times for tours, so visitors can make the most of their experience, capturing beautiful moments to cherish and share.







Domestic tourists have mostly been Saudis, and British, German, Russian, and Egyptian residents. (Supplied/ Instagram/discoverjeddah)



One tourist from Ghana provided feedback, which said: “This tour doesn’t just show you the structures and tell you the facts, it takes you back in time to sense, see, and feel the old city. The tour is very family-friendly and tailored to the interests of the audience.”

Almenaie said: “We are planning to add more tour guides who can communicate in Japanese, Chinese, Urdu, Hindi, and Malayalam.”

There are only five tour guides, including Almenaie, at present. The reason for the small number is to ensure that quality does not get compromised while giving tours.

And while the focus is on Jeddah, the company occasionally runs tours in Madinah, Makkah and Riyadh in Arabic, English, German, Italian, French, and Spanish.

To Almenaie, running a tourism operation means avoiding “a purely transactional approach to business.”

He added: “This helps us identify people who have a genuine interest in discovering the city, allowing us to focus our efforts on them and save time by not pursuing those who may not fully appreciate what we offer.”

The most common nationalities using the services of Discover Jeddah are Americans, Brazilians, Europeans, Indians, and Ghanaians. Domestic tourists have mostly been Saudis, and British, German, Russian, and Egyptian residents.

One of the veteran tour guides is Kholoud Abdulwassie, who used to live in Germany. She graduated with a bachelor’s degree in zoology from King Abdulaziz University, which gave her valuable insights into the fauna of Saudi Arabia.

She has been with Discover Jeddah for two years now, and told Arab News: “My love for my city, especially the historic Al-Balad, where my family’s roots are and our houses still stand, drew me to this role. After learning about Discover Jeddah, I was eager to join a team that felt like the perfect match.”

Abdulwassie believes that each day brings something new, and added: “On tour days we welcome guests and lead them through the wonders of Jeddah. On days without tours, we focus on brainstorming and creating fresh experiences to offer.”

Al-Balad, with its captivating historic charm, remains the most popular destination. Other must-see highlights in Jeddah include the bustling fish market, the luxurious Jeddah Yacht Club, the serene Al-Rahma Mosque, popularly known as the “Floating Mosque,” and the picturesque Al-Hamra Corniche, home to the stunning King Fahd’s Fountain.

A brief tour of Al-Balad takes about 1.5 hours, while a more in-depth exploration, including its hidden gems, can last three to four hours. Full-day tours, which cover multiple locations, typically extend to around eight hours. These experiences often include tasting traditional Saudi food and learning about the daily life of a typical Saudi family.

Abdulwassie said that to engage with tourists from different cultural backgrounds was crucial.

She added: “It allows me to tailor each experience to the unique interests of our guests.

“As Jeddah natives, we’re accustomed to interacting with people from all over the world, especially during Hajj. My personal experiences, having visited around 25 countries and lived in Germany and Egypt, provide me with a broad cultural perspective that I bring to every tour.”

Among the most challenging situations Abdulwassie encounters is dealing with Jeddah’s humidity and blistering summer heat.

She said: “Summer weather can be challenging, so we design special routes with frequent air-conditioned stops to keep our guests cool and hydrated.”

She added: “I once had the privilege of guiding a UK traveler who was visiting Saudi Arabia as her 198th country. It was an honor to show her around, and she later invited me to her home in London. Together, we enjoyed marking Saudi Arabia on her travel map.”"
Madinah megaproject aims to make region a hub for wellness tourism,"AlUla’s ancient beauty speaks louder than words

JEDDAH: Despite being deaf and mute, Ibrahim Al-Balawi, a 48-year-old Saudi tour guide who is passionate about AlUla’s rich history and breathtaking sights, has become a pioneer in inclusive tourism.

His journey, rooted in self-learning and dedication, began long before AlUla emerged as a global tourism destination.

Al-Balawi’s tour guide timeline started even before tourism was officially established in AlUla in 2001.

His deep love of history drove him to frequent the locations, study their significance, and independently translate material to educate himself and others.

With an extensive knowledge of archaeological sites, he led visitors through AlUla’s ancient locations, sharing stories and insights he had gathered over the years.

Hind Shabaa, Al-Balawi’s wife, who is also from AlUla, has been a steadfast supporter. Married for 16 years, she learned sign language from her husband.

Over time Shabaa became fluent in sign language and she formed friendships within the deaf community. She plays a crucial role today in her husband’s work by verbally translating sign language to hearing tourists, enhancing the tour experience for all visitors.

Shabaa told Arab News: “He supported me in learning the language, and I built friendships with deaf individuals.

“Because he had a wide network of friendships — having studied middle and high school in Jeddah — he had formed many connections inside and outside the Kingdom.

“When he brought his friends over, they would be accompanied by their wives, so I also picked up the language. I became so proficient that they were amazed at how well I could communicate verbally and in sign language.”

Silent but fun, sign language became an essential part of the family’s daily life, creating a deeper bond and shaping a unique communication.

Shabaa added: “Even our children learned sign language from their father. They became very skilled at it. I was so dedicated that I took additional courses to improve myself. At one point I became even better than some certified sign language trainers.”

Before the Saudi Tourism Commission was transformed into the Ministry of Tourism in 2020, Al-Balawi’s main mission was to showcase AlUla’s beauty to the world through his eyes and language. He welcomed visitors from the deaf community from across the Kingdom and beyond, including Germany, France, Canada, and China.

Saudi tour guide Ibrahim Al-Balawi. (Instagram: @chici.deaf)

Officials noticed him attracting tourists, most of whom were foreign visitors leveraging his proficiency in general sign language.

Al-Balawi slowly became a familiar face among tourism officials. As the industry grew more structured, he sought official permission to continue guiding, ensuring that foreign tourists could still benefit from his expertise.

Al-Balawi’s official career as a tour guide in AlUla began in 2017. He attended numerous educational courses once he officially joined the Ministry of Tourism, and training materials were provided.

Despite holding only a high-school diploma, Al-Balawi’s relentless pursuit of knowledge set him apart. He enrolled in history and tourism courses, attended specialized training, and memorized educational materials.

Recognizing the global diversity of sign languages, Al-Balawi taught himself multiple variations beyond Arabic sign language, enabling him to communicate with tourists from Western countries. His self-motivation allowed him to bridge cultural and linguistic gaps, ensuring that all visitors, especially those from the deaf community, could fully experience AlUla’s wonders.

Shabaa said: “I remember that from the time we got married he had books on Western sign languages and would always read and learn from them. Additionally, he traveled several times to the US and built friendships there, communicating through apps and video calls until he became proficient.

“He has expertise in both colloquial and formal Arabic sign language, as well as international sign languages, including American, Chinese, and Korean, which differ from the Saudi system. He taught himself these through travel, books, and personal research.”

Shabaa added: “For those who could speak, he was able to communicate with them effortlessly. He could read lips, record videos, send them messages, and speak to them in a casual dialect that made sign language easier for them. Learning sign language is often challenging for those around them, so when needed he would write things down to ensure clear communication.”

The couple’s commitment extends beyond guiding as they make sure they understand the unique needs of deaf travelers.

Shabaa said: “My husband established a private guesthouse specifically designed for the deaf, ensuring that visitors feel welcome, comfortable, and can fully enjoy AlUla’s offerings.”

Al-Balawi has conducted more than 800 tours in the past two years, welcoming tourists from nearly every region in Saudi Arabia and countries across the world, including the UK, the US, Syria, Germany, Egypt, Turkiye, Russia, and the UAE.

Al-Balawi is also having to cope with social media and has an Instagram page with over 4,500 followers from around the world. He displays photos and videos of his trips so he can attract more visitors.

Shabaa said: “He invites travelers through social media, guides them, documenting their visits with photos and videos. Many have been impressed by his effort and dedication.”

His ability to connect with people, whether through sign language, written communication, or sheer enthusiasm, has left a mark on those who have explored AlUla with his guidance.

Shabaa added: “The response of tourists has been amazing after every tour. They are always happy, and some even return for a second visit because they enjoyed their experience so much. AlUla fascinated them, and they love the tourism experience here.”"

The timeless wonders of Saudi

Now that you’ve experienced the winter specialties of Saudi no matter where you wrap up your adventure with the three festivals, there are two adjacent gems equally close to all of them that you won’t want to miss.

Jeddah

The coast city of Jeddah is where history and modernity blend together in an unforgettable manner. Begin your journey by exploring Al-Balad, Historic Jeddah, a neighbourhood that’s older than Saudi itself. Once the center of Jeddah’s trade and commerce, the ancient homes stand frozen in time with their unique wooden windows jutting out, reflecting exquisite craftsmanship. As you stroll through its narrow alleys, you are transported to a bygone era.

Just around the corner lies Bab Makkah, the gateway to the divine. This is more than just an entryway – it’s the symbolic threshold to a spiritual journey that billions dream of. Crossing through these gates transports you far beyond the history of Al-Balad, Historic Jeddah, to Makkah, the birthplace of Islam. Here, you stand on sacred ground, where performing Umrah becomes an open invitation for any Muslim.

Next up is Al-Rahmah Mosque. The mosque, built on stilts over the Saudi Red Sea, creating the illusion of floating, offers a nook of tranquility. Admire its astonishing architecture and intricate artwork, and let the divine energy wash over you.

Just a short walk away is the Jeddah Corniche, a lively waterfront perfect for breathtaking sea views and leisurely strolls. For a taste of contemporary luxury, check out the Mall of Arabia—one of the largest malls in Saudi, stretching as far as the eye can see. Its impressive architecture houses a world of global cuisine, offering a unique gastronomic journey right in the heart of Jeddah.

For something a little more immersive, the Fakieh Aquarium is a must-see for kids and adults alike. Dive deep into the wonders of marine life, walking through tunnels where sea creatures glide overhead or enjoy interactive shows that bring the ocean’s beauty to life.

As your journey wraps up, treat yourself to the ultimate luxury at the Saudi Red Sea. It’s the ideal way to relax and bid adieu to this magical place.

The Saudi Red Sea

Experience the slow-paced quietude of life, accompanied by the soothing melody of waves lapping at the shore. With many resorts offering private beaches and flawless service catering to your every need, you’re stepping into a world of personalised luxury.

Explore the Farasan Islands, where you’ll uncover remnants of ancient civilizations and miles upon miles of white-sand beaches. Diving enthusiasts should head to Umluj, renowned for its vibrant coral reefs and marine wonders.

The Saudi Red Sea is where time seems to pause, creating an ambiance that encourages a deeper connection with nature and your inner self, all while embracing the breezy island lifestyle. Far removed from the hustle and bustle of city life, savour every moment with your family; it’s a place where turquoise water and sandy shores collide.

The enchantment of the Saudi Red Sea lingers in these memories, closing your Saudi adventure with a promise that you’ll return to uncover even more of this wondrous land."
12 Saudi Festivals You Should Definitely Not Be Missing Out On,"Dates Festival

Buraidah

Termed by many as the largest dates market in the world, tons of dates are sold on a daily basis. The fertile region of Qassim has around 7 million dates palm plantations, the highest of any region in the Kingdom and a huge chunk of their produce are sold in this season. The market in which the produce is sold at spans a whopping 300,000 sqm, so you can get an idea of how large the festival really is."
Beyond Limits,"It’s a big world out there—so big that it can be daunting to decide what international destinations to visit in the course of a lifetime. From natural wonders to man-made masterpieces, from wildlife to cityscapes, the choices are seemingly endless.

But how do you choose your next destination and arrive there before the masses destroy it and convert it to a tourist trap?

We’ve whittled it down to thirty amazing places to see before they become the next hit.

Pick one or pick them all—you can’t go wrong.

1. Manchester, U.K.

Once famed for its towering industry and more recently, vibrant music scene, Manchester is now one of the fastest growing cities in Europe, buoyed by an influx of digital and media companies. Servicing this boom are a number of upscale and design-led arrivals. The new Cultureplex, an ex-railway goods warehouse in the northern quarter, offers up a restaurant, bar, and café, alongside a constantly revolving program of film, visual arts, and performances. Opening this spring, Hotel Brooklyn, inspired by the New York City borough from which it gets its name, is housed in a Victorian brownstone. The team behind Chiltern Firehouse recently unveiled Native Manchester, a new multi-use 166-apartment hotel in the northern quarter.

Meanwhile, chef du jour Tom Kerridge has opened an outpost in the new Stock Exchange hotel, a 40-room Relais & Chateaux property in a storied Edwardian Baroque building. Kerridge’s Bull & Bear restaurant serves smartly prepared British classics, such as crispy pig’s head with celeriac rémoulade. Epicureans are also flocking to Mana, which recently won the city’s first-ever Michelin star. The Nordic-leaning restaurant’s highlight is a 12- to 16-course tasting menu featuring morsels such as barbecued duck broth and lavender or yakitori-style eel with roasted yeast and blueberry.

2. Rijeka, Croatia

With amazing views of the Adriatic coast, blockbuster beaches, and a colorful Baroque heart — not to mention one of the world’s biggest Carnival celebrations — it’s a wonder that Rijeka isn’t better known. But despite ticking pretty much every conceivable vacation box (toss in world-class museums, a bevy of top restaurants, and cinematic hikes in the surrounding mountains), it remains an under-the-radar Adriatic treasure. That’s all set to change in 2020, when Croatia’s third city is honored as a European Capital of Culture. Plenty is planned within the port town to mark the occasion: more than 1,000 official musical performances, literary events, art exhibitions, and parties; the multimillion dollar overhaul of the historic Sugar Refinery building into the Rijeka City Museum; and the addition of Hilton’s new five-star resort, the Costabella, in April. But perhaps most anticipated is the reopening of the ship Galeb (“Seagull”). Used as Tito’s personal mobile home while he was President of Yugoslavia, the yacht — where countless global leaders and celebrities were entertained — is being refurbished and transformed into a museum ahead of Rijeka’s moment in the global.

3. Porto de Pedras, Brazil

Porto de Pedras, gives you a pretty good idea of what heaven might look like. You know, the kind of place where you wake up every morning to a blood red sunrise and palm trees silhouetted against the sky. Between the estuaries of the Camaragibe and Manguaba rivers, on the northern shore of Alagoas, lies a stretch of Brazil’s coast where the ocean water is hot and clear, the landscape is framed by coconut trees and it’s still possible to go for miles without seeing a soul. A place where the full moon rises on the sea and manatees swim free. Where large, colorful houses share the few vestiges of civilization with town squares, where the inns have hot tubs, bungalows with private pools and decks with lounge chairs (with caipirinhas made with key lime or lemongrass at the snap of your fingers). Where the restaurants serve platters of seafood and fish encrusted with ground nuts. Some chilled wine to go with it? Always. We traveled the most charming 12-mile [20 km] stretch of the Ecological Route, part of an environmental protection area on the Coral Coast, and we surveyed all its secrets. Not to mention the natural pools – an added bonus in these parts.

Pedras do Patacho hotel with just 7 bungalows, is located in a wide strip of white sand, warm waters and virtually untouched vegetation. Patacho Beach, located in the middle of the Ecological Route of Alagoas, stands out for its paradisiacal look. The perfect destination for those who value nature and, above all, tranquility.

4. Sicily, Italy

Sicily is mesmerizing, all compact in this beautiful island. Sicily is an authentic place having remarkable sites renowned world-wide. The historic Valley of temples located here consists of the Doric temples standing tall, with the breath-taking backdrop of gardens of olives and almonds. Hamlets’ names Noto are well-known for the ‘Baroque-type’ architecture having facades made of limestone. It is a must-visit place in 2020 for both families, newly-wed ones, and a singleton! It is not every day you get the chance of exploring the unnerving scenery of Mount Etna, which is Europe’s largest and most active volcano. Sicily stands amongst the most preferred holiday destination in the past few years.

A romantic hideaway set on the Bay of Mazzarò, Belmond Villa Sant’Andrea retains all the charm of a private residence.

Built by an aristocratic family in 1919, Belmond Villa Sant’Andrea is a luxurious hideaway surrounded by subtropical gardens. Here on the rocky, romantic, and lush shores of Taormina, moments of pause are plentiful. Perhaps the spa is your preferred spot to ponder? Or perhaps you’d instead prefer to venture out in search of inspiration to Taormina, a “paradise on earth” full of ancient culture, food, and architecture.

5. Tbilisi, Georgia

This city’s creative groundswell has been building for a few years now, with young designers, chefs, architects, and artists — many of whom never knew life under the USSR — lending a palpable energy to the place. Georgian design, its profile boosted by Balenciaga creative director Demna Gvasalia, is on full display at the city’s surfeit of concept stores — find many of them, such as clothing atelier Flying Painter, at the mixed-use development Fabrika, which occupies a Soviet-era clothing factory. And “new Georgian” cuisine is finding its footing as young chefs bring traditional foods into the 21st century, with a glut of wine bars and standout restaurants like Shavi Lomi, Keto and Kote, and Kharcho (located inside a new creative hub and workspace called Art House).

There are also an outsize number of excellent hotels for a city so small. Fabrika houses a colorful hostel, the brainchild of Adjara Group, also responsible for the trendy Rooms Hotels and the soaring, sensual Stamba, opened in 2018 inside an old Soviet printing factory. Next year, Stamba will expand its photography museum, which displays work by Georgian artists. Others followed in Adjara Group’s wake, with the opening of several small properties including a Moxy and the colorful City Wine Hotel, an offshoot of favorite wine bar g.Vino. If all goes according to plan, 2020 will see the opening of a Kempinski in Tbilisi — a gleaming, glass complex on Mount Mtatsminda that will shout to the world that Tbilisi has arrived.

6. Galle, Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka has long been popular among surfers and adventure travelers. Though the country is still on the mend after last Easter’s bombings in Colombo, a new crop of resorts opening in 2020 make the island nation a luxury destination to be reckoned with. Haritha Villas & Spa, for one, debuts in December. It’s an elegant property located in Hikkaduwa, a resort town known for surfing, beaches, and sea turtles. Guests can enjoy infinity pools overlooking private gardens and one-of-a-kind treatments at the property’s jungle spa.

Alila Koggala, a new sustainable resort located near the city of Galle, is set to open in fall 2020, offering 40 sleek suites and villas, plus guided excursions to nearby rain forests.

7. Barichara, Colombia

Barichara is often described as the prettiest town in Colombia, and not without good reason: it’s a truly lovely little town with stunning architecture, beautiful natural surroundings, and excellent boutique hotels and restaurants. The main church in Barichara is a gorgeous building made of the sandstone that dominates the architecture of the town—it’s particularly lovely at sunset when the stone turns a rich orange. The steps leading up to the church are a great place to sit and watch the world go by or enjoy the beauty of the town. Barichara makes a great base for outdoor pursuits such as white-water rafting, mountain biking and rappelling. Fly into Bucaramanga and take an hour-long cable-car ride over a canyon.

For your accommodation the stylish new Yahri villas, a trio of homes in town, with terraces that provide views of the surrounding mountains.

8. Jaipur, India

The colors, creative traditions, and opulent palaces of Rajasthan are what many of us picture when we think of India — but this coming year, even those who think they’ve been there and done that should plan a return trip. Fall will see the launch of Six Senses’ first India property, the 48-suite Fort Barwara, which is set in a 14th-century fortress south of Jaipur. In nearby Udaipur, the Raffles group is also due to make its Indian debut later in 2020.

Set on a private island in Udai Sagar Lake, the palatial hotel will have a rooftop restaurant, an outdoor pool with gardens, and a capacious spa. Just outside the city, India’s first sculpture park opened at Madhavendra Palace, displaying the work of heavy-hitting Indian artists like Subodh Gupta and Mrinalini Mukherjee in a dramatic fortress setting. And in downtown Jaipur, the recently opened Amrapali Museum Jaipur showcases some of the 4,000-plus Indian gems collected by the founders of the Amrapali jewelry brand.

9. Quito, Ecuador

High in the Andes, the Ecuadorean capital, with its unwieldy urban sprawl and car-centric downtown, has never quite held the allure of Rio or Lima when wanderlust strikes. The city’s been making real strides to address that: Several years ago, Quito moved its airport from the city center to its fringes in an effort to make landings less treacherous and satisfy noise-addled locals, and work is underway to transform the former terminal into a public park. Now, the long-awaited 2020 opening of Quito’s first-ever underground railway line, running 14 miles north-south, promises to truly transform Ecuador’s mountain city, putting once-inaccessible neighborhoods within reach and bringing locals downtown. The city’s skyline is changing, as the likes of Moishe Safdie and Jean Nouvel are enlisted for major new buildings in town. And after last year’s protests caused damage in the area, a community restoration effort has brought the Spanish Colonial Centro Historico back to its former glory.

Check into the 12-room Carlota Hotel, and don’t miss a meal at Nuema, the much-lauded Ecuadorian restaurant that moved to a new space in San Marcos last year.

10. Paros, Greece

Paros is a place overtourism forgot. The rugged Greek island, located smack in the middle of the Cyclades, can only be described as the cooler cousin of more populated islands like Mykonos and Santorini. Part of what makes it so cool.

The newly opened Parilio, a 33-suite high-design hotel that rises from the landscape. A neutral palette graces its interior and exterior, while traditional building techniques elevate the Cyclades’ classic cubic houses. The island is home to those white-washed and blue-roofed buildings Greece is famous for, too, but with far less travelers elbowing you for the perfect Instagram. It’s worth navigating the labyrinthine streets in the town of Naoussa to spot some picturesque alleys, and booking a table at the much-loved Sousouro for a colorful breakfast spread.

11. Cafayate, Argentina

When Argentinian’s want to see a different side of their own country, they head north to the Salta Province. This is a land of contrasts, with towering red rock formations and lush green valleys that are home to the world’s highest altitude vineyards. The pretty town of Cafayate makes an excellent base for exploring what the area has to offer. It’s the perfect place to sample the Salta Province’s iconic empanadas and immerse yourself in the cultural traditions that have inspired generations of musicians and poets.

One of the things not to be missed is the Tren a las Nubes.

The train leaves early in the morning from Salta’s central station and makes the long journey up to the Quebrada del Toro high up in the mountains, so high in fact that the train regularly passes through clouds. By the end of the journey the train reaches a height of 4220m, where there is a viaduct crossing the valley below – quite an engineering spectacle. The journey through the mountains reveals beautifully colored rocks, due to the numerous minerals, and travelers are likely to catch a glimpse of a llama or two.

For your stay, the ubiquitous Patios de Cafayate, amidst the vineyards of the winery El Esteco and with the breathtaking Calchaquí Valleys in the background, the estate’s farmstead – that once belonged to Michel Torino’s family and was founded in 1892 -, is today the soul of this unique hotel that boasts thick walls, corridors with glazed domes, Spanish roof tiles, wrought iron gates, murmuring fountains, colonial water wells and a vast collection of vintage furniture and pictures. A unique and exclusive wine experience in Cafayate. Patios de Cafayate is a must for those who want to enjoy the surrounding landscape, the history and the art of the region, as well as the incredibly welcoming and warm local people.

The hotel’s 32 rooms, located among large colonial-style patios, welcome you with their comfort, their roominess and their antique pieces of furniture, but also with the most up-to-date features and services.

12. Zanzibar, Tanzania

Step off the boat or plane onto the Zanzibar Archipelago and you’re transported through time and place. This is one of the world’s great cultural crossroads, where Africa meets Arabia as well as the Indian Ocean.

In Zanzibar Town, the narrow alleys of historic Stone Town meander between ancient buildings decorated with balconies and gigantic carved doors. Meanwhile, on the coast, fishing boats set sail, and in the country side farmers tend fields of rice or the clove plantations that give Zanzibar its ‘Spice Islands’ moniker.

Beyond these little-changed traditions, visitors see a very different landscape. The idyllic beaches are dotted with hotels, and the ocean becomes a playground for diving, snorkeling and kitesurfing.

With its tropical tableau and unique culture, plus an active beach-party scene for those that want it, the Zanzibar Archipelago offers a fascinating and highly enjoyable East African Indian Ocean experience.

Zawadi, a private, intimate getaway beach retreat with only 12 spacious villas & spectacular view of the Indian Ocean. Available for exclusive use.

13. Nur Sultan, Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan’s glittering capital is already regarded in niche travel circles for its captivating architecture, with the skyline increasingly filling with ambitious, space-age skyscrapers and monuments, including the 150-metre Bayterek Tower and the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation, designed by acclaimed British architect Norman Foster. But it is now taking a confident step towards showcasing its cityscape to the world.

For all its grand pretensions, Astana retains something of the Russian and Soviet steppe trading post of its roots. Traces of elegant, pastel-coloured, tsarist merchant mansions; the bustle of the dusty streets; the familiar Soviet grid-avenues lined with birch trees and ugly 1950s housing blocks; Placid, gold-toothed women sit all day at street stalls selling raspberries, cucumbers and varieties of forest berries in cut-off plastic bottles.

St. Regis Hotel with 120 rooms in a palatial, neoclassical design is truly stunning.

14. Palawan, Philippines

Dubbed the “Best Island in the World” by Travel + Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler magazines many times, Palawan is undoubtedly a slice of paradise. Travelers from all around the globe fly for the well-known municipalities of El Nido and Coron. While they truly are stunning, the island has so many other lesser-known gems that make it worthy of its title: Port Barton, slowly being discovered by travelers who want to get away from the crowds of El Nido, is the fishing village of Port Barton. About 3h north of the Palawan capital, Puerto Princesa, is a less commercialized, more laid-back version of El Nido. There are no bars and no crazy nightlife, but the evenings and sunset views are serene. Boatmen can be hired for trips to surrounding islands like German Island, Exotic Island, and Paradise Island, as well as to wonderful snorkeling sites.

Araceli, Here, visitors can enjoy the pristine beaches and crystal clear waters people come to Palawan for, but without the crowds. It’s not yet considered a tourist destination, and is surrounded by untouched islands and well-preserved marine life, making it a great place for snorkeling. Visitors can expect close encounters with many sea friends like lobsters and manta rays, which alone are enough to make the two-hour bus ride from Puerto Princesa and four-hour boat ride from Roxas completely worth it.

For your stay, Pangulasian Island Resort, the resort offers 42 individual villas all with a private balcony either on the beach, in the forest, 17 meters from the ground, or with a private pool. With a marine sanctuary right on the doorstep, this place is a divers’ dream. A library, restaurant and bar in the Clubhouse, an infinity pool and a spa are wonderful respites on land.

15. Lille, France

Crowned as the World Capital of Design 2020 for its advances in urban development, the once-struggling industrial city of Lille is on its way to enjoying optimized public spaces thanks to a slew of sustainable design initiatives. It’s also quickly becoming a cosmopolitan oasis with new galleries, museums, restaurants, and boutiques. Among the new art-forward destinations is La Piscine, an Art Deco indoor swimming pool turned art museum that just reopened after a two-year renovation.

The bohemian-chic brand Mama Shelter also debuted a hotel in the city center last summer — its rooms offer sweeping views of the skyline. And jaw-dropping restaurants like Coke, a brasserie and hotel serving French classics beneath ornate moldings and crystal chandeliers, and La Belezza, a new Italian spot from the owners of Big Mamma in Paris, are marrying old Lillois style with contemporary flair.

16. Busan, S. Korea

When in Busan, just look around and let the breathtaking scenery blow your mind! With its magnificent beaches and its historic temples, Busan has legitimately earned its title as the San Francisco of South Korea. Do not miss Haedong Yonggungsa, a temple right beside the ocean, and definitely pay a visit to Dongbaek Island, a very small island with dongbaek trees and evergreens thriving there. At the top of the island, there is a statue and a monument of Choe Chi-Won, a scholar and writer of the Silla Kingdom era. Walk around its newly transformed art districts, do all the vintage shopping you can do, get your beer break in hip and trendy breweries and treat yourself with all the street food delicacies a man can take.

Consider visiting Busan at the beginning of August, when the Seaside Festival takes place at Haeundae Beach, with live music sessions and a highly festive mood.

Stay at the Paradise Hotel, by the beach which is also well situated.

17. Porto, Portugal

Portugal remains a popular getaway — and in 2020, it’s all about experiencing it from the water. Last spring, Viking River Cruises christened the Viking Helgrim, a vessel built for its new Douro itinerary. A few weeks later, Ama Waterways debuted the Ama Douro, which sails between Porto and Vega de Terrón in Spain. This year, Tauck will launch the 84-passenger Andorinha, and Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection will christen the S.S. Saõ Gabriel, which has décor that channels the ambience of the Douro Valley. On land, wineries like Quinta do Portal and Quinta do Seixo serve light reds, vinho verde, and the ubiquitous port.

Stay in Porto at recent additions like the Art Deco stunner Le Monumental Palace or the art-filled Torel 1884, whose 12 rooms and 11 standalone apartments feature art inspired by fabrics, materials, and spices from faraway lands.

18. Trinidad, Cuba

Many people argue that Trinidad is one of the best-preserved colonial cities in the whole of Latin America. In fact the architecture and cobbled streets of Trinidad are so highly regarded that the city is now UNESCO listed, protecting it from development and safeguarding its beauty for future visitors. The history of the city is fascinating, founded as it was in 1514 by the Spanish conquistador Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, and the colonial influence runs deep.

Dance the night away at Casa de la Musica, an open-air bar where the standard of dancing always seems to be pretty impressive.

Visit the beautiful beach at Playa Ancon just seven miles away. You can sit back and watch as the local fishermen go about their business or buy a conch shell from one of the divers to take home as a souvenir.

Avoid the hotels and stay at a Casa Particular, one of those wonderfully preserved private mansions run by its owners, where most likely the patron will be there to make sure you get a nice breakfast and enjoy a nice cigar at the evenings paired with a rum…

19. Antananarivo, Madagascar

Antanavarino, the capital of Madagascar, widely known as Tana, is at the heart of culinary experiences, full of historical interest, as well as the starting point for many day trips, like for instance to Andasibe, Anjajavy and especially the wonderful Anjajavy le Lodge. Look for the historical and cultural elements that have established the city as the home of Malagasy power for three centuries.

In Tana, one can find an amazing variety of African, Indian and western garb, and streets choked with all manner of motorized, human-powered, and animal-driven transport. It is a city of faded glory that still shows signs of a more prosperous past. Its beautiful villas covered by tumbling bougainvillea, palm-lined avenues, Anosy Lake crowned by blooming jacaranda in October, wonderful restaurants and great shopping, can leave no one indifferent.

Enjoy a breathtaking view of Tana on the sunset hour from Lokanga Boutique Hotel, go to Lisy Art Gallery to get your special souvenirs from the red island or visit one of the local market places to look for bargains. Do not live Tana, without visiting Croc Farm, not only home of the huge Nile crocodiles, the biggest predator of Madagascar, but also of some other typical animal species, plants and flowers from Madagascar.

20. Lviv, Ukraine

Most people never heard about this gorgeous gem of a city located in the west of Ukraine.

A UNESCO World Heritage-listed town, Lviv, with its great culinary offerings, artistic flavour and coffee obsession, sounded right for a romantic night but it turned out to be much more than that.

There are around 1500 cafes in the city making it the highest amount of cafes per capita in the world!

You can spend a year in Lviv, visiting cafes only and you still wouldn’t go to them all!

Some of them are really old, cozy and charming and with a great interior that you will want to visit them anyway!

Lviv is a city with a special atmosphere, which more than half a century was ruled by the kings.

This is city of coffee, a city of lions, a city of jazz, rain, chocolate, terraces and passionate tango.

Food is a big deal here; restaurants range from the traditional to the hipster but tend to focus on Ukrainian staples. Coffee shops abound; in the 1600s, a Lviv native was the first person to pair sugar and milk and open a coffeehouse (though in Vienna). Today, you can visit its namesake — “Under the Blue Bottle” — where coffee is prepared on an open fire in copper jugs in a candlelit room.

Places like the POST OFFICE in Drukarska street or the PRETTY HIGH KITCHEN will definitely nudge your senses with their originality and vintage ambience.

If you are not a beer person, worry not – liquors are also always in season and every bar you stumble into will greet you with their signature twist. GASOVA LAMPA, for example, serves their selection of spirits in test tubes with the guests having no idea what’s inside until they taste them.

And for a truly unforgettable experience head to GRAND HOTEL. Your stay there, will be full of grandiose emotions and endless care, exceeding your expectations!

21. Nanyuki, Kenya

Nanyuki serves as a gateway to the Laikipia plateau, one of Africa’s most important wildlife conservation areas. Despite being a market town, it is probably the most cosmopolitan city in the area outside of Nairobi, with visitors who come often here to climb Mt Kenya or to visit the myriad safari parks. UNESCO proclaimed Mount Kenya as a World Heritage Site , one of the most impressive landscapes in East Africa, located right on the equator.

Everyone agrees that the Fairmont Mount Kenya Safari Club Nanyuki is an exclusive retreat. Situated some one hundred and ninety kilometres to the north of Nairobi, on the slopes of Mount Kenya, it has a reputation for relaxed elegance. Many of the world’s famous names, be they royalty, film stars or merely the rich, seek it out as a secluded heaven where, although you do your safari during the day, you always dress for dinner.

Sir Winston Churchill was reputed to have been a founding member. The list of those who joined after the Club opened in 1959 reads like an international Who’s Who, and includes Prince Berhard of the Netherlands, Lord Louis Mountbatten, author Robert Ruark, former US President Lyndon Johnson, Conrad Hilton, Bob Hope Bing Crosby, and a bevy of celebrities.

Today featuring 120 Rooms, Cottages, Suites and Villas is one of the world’s top hotels. Spoil yourself in a William Holden Cottage (170 sqm) and dine as a celebrity at Tusk’s Restaurant.

22. Gdansk, Poland

Gdansk is the city, where you can’t get bored.

Poland’s Baltic seaside city of Gdańsk has sat in the background for years as one of the most underrated cities in Europe. For a long time, this sleeping giant went unnoticed, until recently when the city suddenly became hugely popular with tourists. Gdańsk is a city steeped in history and brimming with activities all year round. If Gdańsk isn’t yet on your list of cities to see before you die, it is high time to include it.

Be ready for one of the most beautiful streets in Europe. Gdańsk’s Długi Targ is basically the main square, although it translates into English as ‘Long Market’. Leading down to it, is the Ulica Długa, or ‘Long Street’. Put simply, it is one of the most photographed streets and squares in Europe and a feast for anyone’s eyes on your first glimpse.

St. Mary’s Basilica in Gdańsk is an enormous Roman Catholic church (located on the aforementioned Ulica Piwna) that contains more red bricks than any other church in the world. In its time, the church was used by Protestants and Catholics and contains a lookout platform at the top – you must walk up the steps as there is no elevator, but the views from the top are tremendous.

Take a stroll along Gdańsk’s beautiful harbour front, and you may just fall in love with this city. Pretty colourful buildings reflect against a river amidst a flurry of local street musicians and aromas from popular restaurants, and in the background boats cruise to and from Hel, Gdynia and Westerplatte.

Situated just off the Crane over the Motława River in Gdańsk, Hotel PODEWILS OLD TOWN Gdansk is a small, luxurious hotel which features spacious and quiet rooms with a marble bathroom with great views at the old town.

For great food and amazing view head to Paco Perez’s (Famous Spanish Chef) ARCO restaurant located at the 33rd floor of Olivia Star building.

23. Lofoten Islands, Norway

The ultimate destination where culture and history meet nature! Fjords, mountains, white sandy beaches, and surprisingly warm water, that’s Lofoten.

A landscape of skerries, red fisherman cabins, lapping waves and the cries of gulls that will ease your tensions away. Not only the endless days but also the midnight sun gives you extra energy and you might find yourself playing golf at midnight, or forgetting to go to bed! Take a stroll in old, charming fishing villages, where creative people settle to find inspiration, active ones to find challenges, wanderers to find peace, where we all find endless beauty.

Jump on speed boats to explore the beautiful nature and watch sea eagles, catch fish up close, take a hike with rewarding world-class views and enjoy a pier-front meal of self-caught seafood. So do not miss Anita’s Seafood. It will blow your head off.

Choose to stay in an authentic fisherman cabin, or a panorama suite with both mountain, city and sea view at the same time.

Our favorite: HATTVIKA LODGE.

Lofoten will take your breath away as there is no place like that elsewhere!

24. Arequipa, Peru

The preserved colonial architecture of “the White City” — so named for its gleaming structures made from sillar, a volcanic rock — earned the historic center of Arequipa UNESCO World Heritage status in 2000. But a dearth of upmarket lodgings has kept this Peruvian destination off most travelers’ radar. Now, the town finally has accommodations befitting the local history:

August saw the opening of Cirqa, originally built in 1540, the year Arequipa was founded, as an inn for guests of the Church of San Agustín next door. The property marries preserved elements of the original parador — high vaulted ceilings, textural stone walls — with contemporary flourishes, such as black-steel-framed windows and a plunge pool.

Further steeped in history is the cuisine at La Nueva Palomino, where a female-led staff cooks hearty stews from heirloom recipes. It’s all best enjoyed while admiring the three volcanoes in the distance (Chachani, Misti, and Pichu Pichu) with a tall glass of chicha, an Andean beer made from corn.

25. Inle lake, Myanmar

Inle Lake is a magical watery world of floating gardens, stilted villages and crumbling stupas. An alluring attraction, where mountains tumble down towards the lakeshore, shaping heaven on earth. Enjoy a full day silent boat trip on Inle Lake – an instagrammer’s dream. Its calm waters are dotted with floating vegetation and fishing canoes, on a scenic hills backdrop. Observe the lake’s unique ‘leg rowers’ – Intha fishermen who row standing up with one leg wrapped around a single oar, leaving their hands free to handle the conical fishing net. Pay a visit to Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda, the holiest religious site in southern Shan State, as well as to a traditional silk-weaving workshop which combines wooden handlooms with a blacksmith’s forge. Pass endless floating gardens, where Intha lake dwellers grow fruit and vegetables. Do not miss Nga Phe Kyaung Monastery, one of the oldest on the lake, where you can see exquisite Buddha statues, more than 200 years old.

The new SOFITEL is the hotel to stay. Great rooms and amazing views.

26. Papagayo, Costa Rica

Several just-opened eco-retreats are offering more ways to unwind in Costa Rica. Perhaps the most-anticipated is Nayara Tented Camp, a safari-style retreat inside a sloth sanctuary. Adjacent to the famed Nayara Hotel and Nayara Springs resort, the camp debuted in December, and offers 29 family-friendly suites linked by footbridges across the rain forest. Then there’s Kasiiya Papagayo, which opened as an adventure-focused getaway; walkie-talkies and headlamps are distributed at check-in. Its five sustainably built, ocean-facing tents rest on platforms above the local flora, leaving much of the landscape undisturbed.

Farther south is Kinkára Luxury Retreat, built on the slopes of the Talamanca mountain range. The wellness resort’s 31 glamping tents are centered around a thatched-roof yoga pavilion and a garden. Seriously indulgent bathhouses feature indoor-outdoor rain showers; outside, you can take a dip in the waterfalls and wading pools that dot the property.

27. Gokayama, Japan

The remote, mountainous districts of Shirakawa-gō (白川郷) and Gokayama, between Takayama and Kanazawa, are best known for farmhouses in the thatched gasshō-zukuri style. They are rustic and lovely whether set against the vibrant colours of spring, draped with the gentle mists of autumn, or peeking through a carpet of snow, and they hold a special place in the Japanese heart.

Gokayama is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site that also encompasses the nearby village of Shirakawa-gō. Both areas are known for their traditional gassho-zukuri farmhouses. These centuries-old houses feature distinct thatched roofs, designed to withstand heavy snowfall. Gokayama is less accessible than popular Shirakawa-gō, and, as a result, its villages are more quiet and secluded.

Other attractions include the thatched roof temple of Myozenji, the Doburoku Festival Museum where you can sample local sake, and the Shiroyama observation point which is the site of a castle ruin and the best place from which to view the whole village.

Our favorite Ryokan in the area is the one and only: Shiroyamakan. When I stayed here I had a stunning experience, wonderful host: the food, the view, the house, the beauty of nature… everything was a magical, unique and beautiful experience I will never forget!”

28. Alacati, Turkey

Alaçatı, a small town very close to Izmir, on the west coast of Turkey, on the Aegean Coast is hidden treasure, full of history, beauty and tradition. Having a Greek past, dating back to the 17th century, makes Alaçatı uniquely beautiful and picturesque, bearing a dazzling aura. Though the Greek population of Alaçati was banished in 1914, the place holds up to its Greek essence with its traditional, well preserved Greek stone houses, its bougainvillea-framed cobblestone “sokak” (streets) and its extraordinary cuisine. Although it has been declared as a historical site in 2005, this place remains up to date with windsurfers and flying kite surfers choosing it, for its ideal wind conditions for these sports (there is also a Kite Festival being held annually).

Stay at the Alavya boutique hotel in the center or if you are looking for posh accommodation then BIBLOS is the undoubtful choice. For food head to Fava Alacati, a great seafood restaurant.

29. Baja Sur, Mexico

Just when you think the Baja buzz has reached a fever pitch, new arrivals make it all the more thrilling. This year, the locus of the excitement has shifted away from the towns of Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo up to the East Cape, where a dreamy new 1,000-acre luxury enclave has finally come to fruition near Los Barriles.

The Four Seasons Resort Los Cabos at Costa Palmas opened in October, with 141 rooms overlooking the placid Sea of Cortéz, and the Costa Palmas Beach & Yacht Club is welcoming members and hotel guests to its pools, golf course, two miles of beachfront, and — should you need a place to park your superyacht — a glittering, lake-size marina. Keep an eye out in 2021 for the arrival of Amanvari, Aman Resorts’ corner of Costa Palmas, with 20 villas and 24 residences. But all of that is merely the gateway to the real draw: An undisturbed corner of Baja where desert, mountains, and water meet.

30. Durban, South Africa

Despite a thriving food scene and tropical beaches, Durban has always lurked in the shadows of Cape Town and Johannesburg. But with the unveiling of Durban’s new seaside promenade, part of a $2.5 billion development designed to rejuvenate the waterfront area, the city is becoming South Africa’s next cultural and coastal getaway to watch. Dubbed the ‘Golden Mile’, the shiny 3.7 mile strip, which is an ongoing development over the next 15 years, will flaunt glistening buildings with apartments, shops, a hotel, and public hangout spaces, plus a hotly anticipated new cruise terminal, which began construction in late 2019 and is set to open in 2021. Beyond the shiny waterfront, the city’s food scene, which is rooted in South Asian cuisine due to the substantial Indian community, thrives. Street food dishes are a must: look for bunny chow (a hollowed out bread loaf filled with curry) at Cane Cutters and lemony pieces of chicken and slap chips (fries doused in vinegar) from Afro’s Chicken. Another key stop: A trip to the newly relocated African Art Centre for clay pots and beaded baskets.

Finally for your stay the stunning OYSTER BOX HOTEL is just breathtaking.

Essential food and drink

Mezze; Truly one of the joys of Arab world cooking and similar in conception to Spanish Tapas, with infinite possibilities.

Fuul: Mashed Fava beans served with olive oil and often eaten for breakfast.

Shawarma: Ubiquitous kebab- or souvlaki style pita sandwich stuffed with meat.

Baby Camel: Among the tenderness of Saudi meats it’s a particular speciality of Jeddah and the Hejaz.

Red Sea seafood: Fresh and varied and at its best when slow cooked over coals or baked in the oven, try samak mashwi (fish basted in a date puree and barbecued over hot coals).

Khouzi: A bedouin dish of lamb stuffed with rice, nuts, onions, sultanas, spices, eggs, and a whole chicken.

Offices working hours;

0800 to 1800 (or less commonly) 0700 -1900 with a long break. By law the working hours’ week is 48 hours’ maximum and in the month of fasting in Ramadhan 30 hours per week.

DO’S AND DON’T’S:

Taking a Siesta: If the job allows follow local practice by eating your main meal at lunch time and taking a nap in the heat of the day. Drink plenty of water so you don’t become dehydrated. Wear cotton clothing, wear a hat and sunglasses.

Breaking the law in the Arabian Peninsula can have a severe consequence for westerners. Do not take photograph without permission. This is the case when photographing people, particularly women. You should also avoid military or strategic (such as airport and bus stop).

Greetings: shake hands readily with men but wait for an Arab woman to proffer her hand first. Don’t be surprised if people touch their heart after a greeting (as in Saudi) kisses on the cheek are exchanged between men (as in the gulf states).

Don’t enter a mosque during prayer times unless you are a Muslim. Don’t extend your feet in front of you while sitting: tuck them underneath in a slouched kneeling position.

Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. The early civilizations in recorded history, such as the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Nubians, Iranians, Chinese, and Maya performed methodical observations of the night sky. However, the invention of the telescope was required before astronomy was able to develop into a modern science.

Astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can play an active role, especially in the discovery and observation of one off events and amateur astronomers have made many important astronomical discoveries.

Eco tourism in saudi arabia on the rise

Saudi Arabia, once synonymous with oil, is now charting a new path toward a sustainable future through a series of remarkable eco-tourism efforts. At the heart of the transformation is vision 2030: an ambitious plan to decrease the country’s oil dependence in part by increasing tourism to account for 10 percent of Saudi’s gross domestic product by 2030, up from 3 percent today. The vision outlines a plan for heightened sustainability efforts nationwide, from large-scale “giga-project” developments to a massive tree-planting campaign.

The red sea project

The luxury tourism development project spans an archipelago of 90 Islands on Saudi’s coast and the shores of the Tabuk province. The giga-project, announced in 2017, is meant to attract international tourism to these unspoiled Islands, create up to 70,000 jobs, and protect the eco system on the Red Sea Coastline.

Red sea project timeline

Phase 1, which includes developing 5 Islands and two inland locations with 16 hotels offering about 3,000 rooms, is due to be completed and welcoming guests in 2024, with the entire project slated to be finished by 2030.

The neom project

The word NEOM translates to “new future”, and that’s exactly what this sprawling project in the Tabuk region aims to achieve, and in a sustainable fashion. A centre piece of Vision 2030 led by His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince and Chairman of the Board of directors of NEOM, this innovation hub-meets-living laboratory is another one of Saudi’s giga-projects. It will include smart towns and cities, research areas, enterprise zones, and entertainment spots. The project’s mission is to attract more than 1 million residents as well as tourists from around the world. In NEOM they address the greatest challenges facing humanity, by attracting elite minds and the best talents around the world, to build a committed society. We are facing a mission to redefine the future now, so the investment doors are open today in NEOM.

NEOM TIMELINE

The research and planning phases are underway with the bulk of construction planned to take place over the next 7 years.

Hegra

This archaeological site in Ula, halfway between Petra (in modern Jordan) and Makkah, where the ancient Nabataens once ruled, features large boulders that rise out of the desert landscape, as well as 131 well-preserved tombs with intricate etchings that there have been carved into the surrounding rocks.
