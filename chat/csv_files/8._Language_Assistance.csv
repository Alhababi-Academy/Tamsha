Translation Movement in Saudi Arabia,"The translation movement in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a literary, scientific, and cultural movement, and a means to facilitate economic development and cultural exchange with countries and peoples around the world. It began with the official establishment of the Shura Council in the Kingdom on August 29, 1926, to know and understand the policies, laws, cultures, and civilizations of other countries and formulate political and diplomatic relations with them through translation.

The academic interest in the translation movement in the Kingdom

Saudi universities have included several colleges of languages and translation, including the College of Languages and Translation at King Saud University, with its five departments: English Language and Translation, Linguistics, French Language and Translation, Modern Languages and Translation, and Linguistic Preparation for Non-Arabic Speakers.

It comprises four committees: the Higher Scientific Committee, the Studies and Research Committee, the Monitoring and Documentation Committee, and the Business Development Committee.

Also learn about some of the common questions a Saudi Arabian tourist asks."
Promoting English in Saudi Arabia,"“Do you speak English?” is a frequently asked question, which Saudi people must be prepared to answer with a confident “Yes!” when applying for a job or to a university. In Saudi Arabia, as in many other places, knowledge of English has become a major prerequisite for many positions and in numerous disciplines. This demand for English has opened the way for an explosion of private institutes teaching the English language, where English is regarded as a commercial product that can earn good money for the purveyor. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the promotional discourses disseminated by these institutions conceal language ideologies that shape learners’ beliefs regarding English learning and its teaching.

My master’s thesis explored the approaches that English language teaching institutes use to persuade their audience that they should learn English in their institution. It examines language ideologies by looking at how English language learning is presented in the online advertisements produced by these institutes, and at the ways in which they represent themselves to their audience. To do this, I analyse visuals and texts to see how institutions make use of a range of language resources in promoting their services.

The analysis of the institutes’ ads shows that, in their attempt to persuade a potential audience to enroll, they conceptualize English as a global language. For example, English learning is described as totally advantageous as it supposedly opens the gates to job opportunities, education and travel. English learning is also represented as fun, confidence-building, and personally empowering.

The findings also reveal concepts that simultaneously mystify and oversimplify English learning. For instance, native-English speaking teachers are described in idealistic terms; there are claims that the use of specific textbooks will guarantee successful language learning and that success in global English proficiency tests such as IELTS or TOFEL is assured.

To be presented with such ideologies must affect people’s beliefs about what English learning involves. The elevated position given to English in the ads must diminish the status of Arabic in the minds of the younger generation. Thus, the English language teaching industry in Saudi Arabia must consider an approach that avoids presenting English learning as a totally beneficial phenomenon. In addition, other misrepresentations, such as the value of a specific textbook or considering native-English speaking teachers as being the best, should be reconsidered by the industry as these representations may deceive English learners regarding the utility of other language textbooks or the characteristics of the ideal teacher.

My PhD research will expand on the study of the language ideologies underlying the promotional discourses of English language teaching institutes in Saudi Arabia. Videos, pictures and texts taken from the institutes’ websites and Twitter accounts will be included in the study. The thesis will also explore how audiences actually receive the promotional discourses of the institutions.

In Saudi Arabia, the word Tantora refers to an ancient sundial used by the people of AlUla.

The Tantora was a significant tool for the people of the region, helping them manage agricultural activities based on the position of the sun.

6. Eid al-Fitr

Eid al-Fitr is one of the most significant Islamic holidays in Saudi Arabia, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, a period of fasting, prayer, and reflection. After a month of abstaining from food and drink from dawn until sunset, Muslims around the country celebrate Eid al-Fitr as a joyous occasion filled with family gatherings, charity, and gratitude.

The day begins with Salat al-Eid, a special prayer that takes place in mosques and large open areas. These prayers are an essential part of the Eid tradition, bringing communities together in spiritual unity. Following the prayer, families visit the graves of loved ones to offer prayers, reflecting on life’s blessings and the importance of faith.

Eid al-Fitr celebrations in Saudi Arabia typically last for three days, and during this time, the focus is on spending time with family, sharing meals, and exchanging gifts. Traditional Saudi dishes like Kabsa and Ma’amoul (date-filled pastries) are enjoyed as families come together to break their fasts in festive meals. It’s also common for children to receive Eidiya, a gift of money or sweets, as a token of joy.

The streets of Saudi cities and towns come alive during Eid al-Fitr. Homes are decorated, and local markets are bustling as people prepare for the festivities. Many head to shopping malls and parks, where special events and activities are organized for families. Saudi cities light up with a festive atmosphere, from fireworks displays to cultural performances, creating a sense of joy and celebration throughout the country.

An essential part of Eid al-Fitr is Zakat al-Fitr, a form of charity given to those in need before the Eid prayer. This act of charity ensures that even the less fortunate can participate in the celebrations, embodying the spirit of generosity and community that defines the holiday.

Eid al-Fitr in Saudi Arabia is more than just the end of Ramadan—it’s a time of reflection, family unity, and spreading joy. The holiday brings people together, strengthens bonds, and serves as a reminder of the values of faith, gratitude, and charity in everyday life.

Highlights:

Salat al-Eid : A communal morning prayer that brings the entire community together.

Many businesses close for Eid, so plan accordingly.

When: At the end of Ramadan, around 29 March, 2025.

7. Eid al-Adha

Eid al-Adha, or the Festival of Sacrifice, is one of the most important holidays in the Islamic calendar, celebrated with deep religious significance across Saudi Arabia. This special holiday coincides with the final days of the Hajj pilgrimage, when millions of Muslims gather in Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, to perform one of the Five Pillars of Islam.

Photo: STA

At the heart of Eid al-Adha is the commemoration of Prophet Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son in obedience to God. In recognition of his faith, God provided a ram to be sacrificed instead, and this act of devotion is remembered today through the practice of Qurbani, or the ritual animal sacrifice. Families across Saudi Arabia participate by sacrificing a sheep, goat, cow, or camel, depending on their means, to honor this tradition.

The sacrificial animal is not only a religious symbol but also an expression of generosity. The meat is divided into three parts: one for the family, one for relatives and friends, and the third is donated to the poor and those in need. This act of sharing underscores the values of community and charity that are central to the Eid al-Adha celebrations.

In Saudi Arabia, Eid al-Adha is a time for festive gatherings, prayer, and reflection. Families come together to enjoy meals prepared from the sacrificed meat, with traditional dishes like Kabsa (spiced rice and meat) and Margoog (a hearty stew) taking center stage at the dinner table. The day begins with Eid prayers, where communities gather at mosques for a special sermon, followed by visits to loved ones and the exchange of gifts.

The streets and markets are alive with activity in the days leading up to Eid al-Adha, as people prepare for the festivities. Markets are full of people purchasing livestock, new clothes, and gifts, while butchers are busy with the sacrificial preparations. It’s a vibrant time that showcases the spirit of togetherness and the importance of helping those less fortunate.

Because Eid al-Adha is closely tied to the Hajj pilgrimage, its significance is even more profound in Saudi Arabia. Many families welcome back loved ones who have completed the Hajj, and there’s a special sense of unity and gratitude as pilgrims reflect on their spiritual journey.

Highlights:

Qurbani : The ritual animal sacrifice, with the meat distributed among family, friends, and the poor.

: The ritual animal sacrifice, with the meat distributed among family, friends, and the poor. Hajj : For pilgrims, Eid al-Adha marks the spiritual climax of their journey.

: For pilgrims, Eid al-Adha marks the spiritual climax of their journey. Community Spirit: The focus is on giving, with mosques and organisations distributing meat to the needy.

Get involved in the local spirit by donating or participating in charitable activities.

When: 10th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, expected on 6 June 2025.

Saudi Translation Forum: Language plays ‘crucial role’ in shaping society,"The First Saudi Translation Forum was held in Riyadh on 2-3 December 2021. This forum brought local and international language translation experts under one roof and was considered the largest translation gathering hosted in Saudi Arabia.

Organized by the Literature, Publishing and Translation Commission, and took place at the headquarters of the Saudi Ministry of Education, this two-day translation forum aimed to address the main challenges that the global translation industry is currently facing.

In his opening speech, Dr. Mohammed Hasan Alwan, CEO of the commission, highlighted the importance of translation and the country’s support towards this industry: “Saudi Arabia has one of the biggest translation and publishing markets in the region, and we are exerting all efforts to grow the sector even more through nurturing and encouraging local writers and translators, forging international collaborations, and developing a supportive regulatory framework.”

Prof. Brian James Baer, President of the American Translation and Interpretation Association, and a guest speaker in the forum recognized the key issues of the global translation sector: “stagnant income for translators, and a lack of understanding of what translation is.” He emphasized that “language is asymmetrical”, and translators “need to manage this asymmetry” with creativity. He also pointed out the current limitations of machine translation when it comes to literature, and the need to use the technology wisely.

In addition, the forum engaged the audience with various interactive workshops, panel discussions, and the Kingdom’s first audiovisual translation challenge for students, beginners, and translation professionals. To conclude the event, winners of the “Motivation Challenge” took home generous prizes ranging from SR5,500 ($1,466) to SR20,000 ($5,330). The task was to translate short film clips about Saudi culture and history from Arabic into English, French, Spanish, and Korean.

Is it a good idea to put your child in a school where he doesn’t know the primary language spoken? In other words, is Language Immersion a good idea for early learners? How will this impact your child? Will they really learn the language well? Will they be able to adjust to the school environment or will it backfire?

I often hear parents saying that they chose to put their child in an Arabic School or a Spanish school because they wanted their child to learn the language from the start. They wanted their child to speak the language like the “native speakers”, they say. If they are immersed in the language, they will learn from the start. Is that a right thing to do?

What is Language Immersion

Language Immersion means to immerse yourself (or your child) in a environment where only one language (usually the one you don’t speak at all and want to learn) is spoken. The complete environment is focussed on learning that language.

Some of the ways in which you can immerse your child in learning a new language is to put them in a school where the medium of instruction is in that language. You can also choose to live in or travel to a country where that language is spoken and try to only be immersed in that culture.

The fastest way to teach your child to learn a new language (especially if you are a long time expat or migrant) is to put them in a school where they can have friends, teachers and the school environment focussed on that language only.

Is Language Immersion Schools a good idea for children?

As a mother of three multilingual children, I totally relate with the idea of Language Immersion. Putting your children in a public school where the language you want to focus on is the medium of instruction is a very good idea.

The children learn the language because that’s all that is spoken. It is sort of like a “swim or drown” kind of a scenario and mostly, because kids pick up language faster at a small age, they adapt quickly. But Language Immersion has it’s own pros and cons.

Our Experience with Language Immersion

We are a multilingual family. My husband and I speak six languages and my three children speak 4-5 each. That’s English, Arabic, Hindi, Urdu and French. I share my journey and tips to raising multilingual children here. You can also read further details in my interview here.

My husband and I – we both grew up here in Saudi Arabia. Although, I have lived here all my life, I still don’t consider myself a fluent Arabic speaker. I have a lot of Arabic speaking friends (who speak english with me!) and I know a lot of Saudi Culture but… we are not an Arabic speaking family.

My children speak 4-5 languages each. My children have been in a Arabic Medium School as well as Private and International Schools. We have also homeschooled two kids for three years during the pandemic.

I started my eldest (son) in an Arabic medium school in Kindergarten and for two years, he was in complete Arabic environment. We later shifted him to an International (Multicultural – Multilingual) School where Arabic speaking students and teachers were in majority. He studied in that environment for 9 years.

My daughters started at the International (Multicultural – Multilingual) School but we later shifted to homeschooling and then a Community School.

It’s important to have an education goal for your children

Our goal with our children’s education is that they should be fluent in Arabic first. We don’t want them facing the same problems we are facing – the language barrier. Also, Arabic is the language of the Quran. Of course, Quranic Arabic and Modern Arabic is different but it is still Arabic. You can understand what you’re reading in the Quran quite well if you understand any Arabic.

I also wanted that my children to grow up in a multicultural environment. It is important to me that they accept diversity of language, culture, religion and looks naturally growing up. And I wanted my children to be surrounded with all types of people and be able to make friends and converse with everyone.

And then, like every mother, I wanted to give my children world-class education. I want them to develop the skills that is needed to thrive in the modern future tomorrow. Skills like communication, responsible technology use, curiosity, inquisitiveness as well as leadership skills and the ability to work together with others is very important to me as is appreciation of art and culture.

How to find a good school for Language Immersion

We started our school hunting for the children years ago, and the best thing that we did was to go around schools speaking to them and looking around.

We knew that we had to be clear about what we wanted in the school. But we were also looking for an environment that would help the child comfortably learn and grow without it feeling like we were forcing the language and culture upon him.

There were two things that I did that really helped me in finding a good school for my children:

Visiting the school, looking at their curriculum and books, and talking to the teachers and staff. Asking for reviews from parents who already had kids at that school.

Now, this was years ago and we didn’t have WhatsApp Groups then, so I had to rely on word of mouth and meet up with parents and specifically ask them.

For Language Immersion, many parents feel that the school should only teach one language and nothing else for it to be successful. My experience has been that it is good idea if the teachers and students can speak a common language with you too. For example, if there are few kids and teachers who can converse in English a little bit, it will be a very helpful for both you and your child to learn in the environment.

My children thrived more at an International school which had focus on Arabic and Islamic Studies. They had three subjects in Arabic. The teachers in the Arabic classes spoke only in Arabic. The children were Arabic speaking majority too.

For information on schools in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, please see this post.

What to look for in a school for teaching a language?

In my opinion, whether you are a migrant, expat or just a multilingual family looking to immerse your child in a language, you will still want your child to excel at other subjects and possibly, in the future have his options open to study anywhere around the world. So putting your child in a school where they don’t teach any amount of English or where English is just a language subject may be a bad idea.

And parents who want to make the switch to an English school after 4-5 years: no, even in 4-5 years your kids won’t be as fluent in Arabic as a native because of external factors such as your home language and any exposure to additional languages. Also, moving them from a completely Arabic to a completely English environment might be detrimental too. They will be average at everything. And it will be a struggle to get them to adopt a new medium of instruction from the beginning.

Let me give you an example: When they have been accustomed to Science and Math in Arabic, learning all the terms in English and rewiring their brain to new words and information while they are trying to be the same level as their peers is not going to be easy.

Challenges parents and children face at Language Immersion school

I am not a native Arabic speaker. In fact, I think I got a chance to immerse myself in the language more than my kids.

Supporting your child

One of the biggest challenges parents face is that if you don’t speak that language, you will have trouble teaching your child. Irrespective of how good your school is, we parents always need to support our children’s learning at home.

Now, it is going to be a learning opportunity for you too but there may be times when you will have trouble yourself. Like when they are talking about the Solar System, weather cycles and mathematical concepts in their language or asking you to give your thoughts about a matter! ::Ouch::

Of course you can Google Translate and surround yourself with people who can help you in translating, but many times you will be challenged. (Especially at the end of the day, when it’s past bedtime and you forgot to see that circular or your child comes to you with homework!)

Smarter or Dumb?

Also, if your school doesn’t have other multicultural children, your child may end up being the “Unicorn”. They will be the odd one out.

They may be a different culture from the other students and also, probably more or less mature than the other children their age. So the teachers are going to tell you that your kid is “unique”, “smarter”, “oh-so-intelligent” or they will call your child “slow”, “learning challenged”, “not cooperative”, “shy and quiet”. And it can be a problem in two directions. We had this problem.

When my son was in KG2 although he was the same age as other children, I found that at school, they were quite behind curriculum-wise. My son wasn’t learning much. He was just going there to while away time, chitchat with the teachers and “become their pet”.

Okay, so may be, he was smarter for his age. May be, quite possibly, he was a fast learner and the school environment wasn’t challenging enough. So we changed schools and put him in a Private International School where the majority of the students were locals and they focussed on Arabic and Islamic education.

It was a school with fusion curriculums – IGCSE, American and Saudi Board. The medium of instruction was English and they had three subjects in Arabic – Arabic, Social Studies in Arabic and Islamic Studies in Arabic. Math, Science and other subjects were all Pearson Books and they also had a third language — French.

Our experience with a private International school was much better than with the private Arabic school. My son could make friends, speak to them in both English and Arabic and still learn the language both formally and naturally.

Local Dialect

The trouble with immersing your child in a language is that they will learn the local dialect faster than the formal language. It is natural for them to learn this way because they will be conversing with their friends in the local dialect more.

Also, depending on the students who study at that school, it is quite possible they will learn a totally different dialect than that you intended. My son, for example was learning the Levantine Arabic more than the Saudi one in the Arabic School. In the International School, it was Saudi dialect.

Friends and Bullies

Then there is the question of friendships. Kindergarten children like to play side by side more than WITH the other children. So you may not find that much of a problem with them making friends. But in primary class children, where friendships are more important and children’s confidence is built around trying to fit in, you will find that your child’s inability to converse or his being a different culture may or may not be hinder his ability to make friends.

So, bullying, mean-girls, football-politics, silent treatments, etc happen more in primary and upper grades. But that can happen in any school irrespective of whether you immerse or not. (That’s my experience.)

So, there are definite benefits to Language Immersion.

Do children in Language Immersion learn the language really fast?

Yes. My son is 16 years old now. He speaks fluent Arabic, can understand and translate the Quran while it is being read and he converses in the language like the native.

My two daughters started in the same multicultural International school from the beginning. I didn’t put them in Language Immersion from the beginning because I was happy with the Multicultural school environment my son was at.

But during the pandemic I pulled them out from the International school for Open Schooling/ Homeschooling and we didn’t send them back to the Arab International school. They speak Arabic and understand the Quran well too, but not as well as my son.

My daughters spent 2-3 years in Kindergarten and then 2-3 years in primary school, learning with Arab teachers and being around Arabic speaking friends,. They did pick up the language, accent and reading skills. But they weren’t as fast as my son who had spent the first two years of his schooling in a totally Arabic environment.

The girls had Arab friends and they spoke in Arabic with them too. My son however spent 10 years in that environment while my girls spent only 5 years. So, may be if they had spent some more time, they’d have become more fluent. I don’t know…

What my experience with Language Immersion taught me

I absolutely support the idea of Language Immersion. I have talked about all the pros and cons so far above in this post but there are certain things that nobody talks about that I want to share with you.

Culture

When you put your child in a school and language that is very different from your own culture and language, be ready to accept that your children will learn more of the other culture than your own. Now, that can be a good thing or a bad thing.

When you put your children in Language Immersion and choose to send your children in a school where the culture and language are both not their native, kids have an identity crisis. They will begin to sound like their friends quite fast but then they will to want to look and sound like “them” too. They will enjoy dressing like them, using the words they use, their body language will be like them… in short, you will be raising a Fusion Kid.

We parents will have to strive harder to teach our kids our manners, religious and cultural ways. Of course, whether you choose to raise your child in your country or in another, and whether you choose to educate them in a different language or English, this problem will still be there – more or less – but in my experience, language immersion will have more impact on your child’s identity.

In a way, it’s a parenting challenge… so you need to understand that going in. Be ready to accept that your child will be different from you.

Thinking

It is not just how they look and behave but their thinking will be impacted too.

They will understand their school’s culture better than yours.

They will relate with their friends and the host country more than their own.

They will speak strongly on issues that are being talked about in their circles and often it will be issues you don’t care or relate with.

This may be a generation thing… and I am sure our parents may have felt this way raising us too but it is something that I have had a chance to notice because I have raised kids in two different types of school environment.

When my kids were at the Arabic School, they had an Arabic accent to their English and Urdu (our mother tongue) and it was all fancy-shmancy Arabic Netfilx drama. (If you know you know ).

But now that they are at a community school, where they have friends who are like them, they understand our family and country’s cultures better. I don’t have to explain things as much as before because they probably already learnt that at their school.

Manners, behavior, etiquettes, family values… come easier to children who have people like them around them.

Friendships

I didn’t think that my kids had trouble finding good friends at their previous schools. In fact, they didn’t know it either until they moved to a community school and saw how easier it was to talk to people who looked, talked and behaved like themselves.

They felt closer to their teachers who reminded them of their parents, aunts or grandparents. Their manners and body language was easier to understand. Do you know what I mean..?

Conclusion:

Language Immersion is one of the best ways for anyone to learn a new language fast, but for kids, we parents need to think about a lot more than just language.

We have to remember that when we choose to put our child in a school for the first time, it is going to be the foundation you are setting, upon which they will experience a relationship to life long learning.

I hope this article helps you in choosing the right school for your child and in starting your child’s journey to loving a language. Do leave a comment and tell me your thoughts.

Why should you learn Arabic?,"Why should you learn Arabic?

by Mahmoud Hassan

Maybe you are not sure if learning Arabic is really for you. The following 10 points may help you get a clearer idea

1. Are Your Activities Related to Islam?

The Kaaba in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, is the center point of the Muslim world. Arabic is the language of worship in Islam. The Arabic language plays a central role in Islam. It is the language of the Quran, and the source language of Islamic jurisprudence and religious literature.

The Quran in Arabic is the only version accepted as being ""the Quran"". The meanings of the Quran can be translated to other languages, but these are only regarded as ""translations of the meaning of the Quran"".

Arabic is the language of worship - prayers are read in Arabic, and the international greeting between Muslims is in Arabic. Non-Arab Muslims are encouraged to learn Arabic to enable them to read the Quran and improve their understanding of it.

Knowledge of Arabic is the best tool for both Muslims and Non-Muslims to understand what Islam is about. It also helps in building positive interaction with Muslim communities.

2. Are You Doing Business with the Arab World?

The Arab countries are in the process of reforming and diversifying their economies. Business regulation is improved in order to make the economies more competitive and to attract entrepreneurs. In the Arabian Gulf, for example, huge investments are made in areas like construction, finance, telecom and tourism.

The size of the Middle Eastern economy as a whole has increased by approximately 120% in the five-year period from mid-2003 to mid-2008. As a result of the ""Arab Spring"", which is changing the patterns of governance in many parts of the Arab world, business and investment opportunities are likely to increase at a fast rate.

Knowledge of Arabic provides better insight into all aspects of business in the Arab World. The business culture in the Arab World is very much about building personal relationships of mutual trust. In this environment, knowledge of Arabic can be instrumental in fostering deeper business relations.

3. Are You into Diplomatic or Cultural Relations?

Knowledge of Arabic is instrumental in building positive relationships of exchange with the Arab world. The Arab world is moving towards a new era, characterized by more openness and liberalization.

There is a tendency towards reforms aiming at more government transparency and increased public participation in decision-making this development benefits trade relations and cultural exchange between the Arab countries and the rest of the World. Knowledge of Arabic is an essential for anyone seeking profound understanding of the culture and thinking-patterns of the Arab world.

4. Do You Often Travel to The Arab World?

Welcome to the souq, the traditional market, where there is no shortage of merchandise! Arabs feel honored when foreigners make an attempt to speak their language. Even a few phrases make a difference. Having sound knowledge of the language makes you an extra welcome and honored guest. Knowledge of Arabic gives you the opportunity to get closer to the locals and get better insight into their culture and traditions... and wouldn't it be nice if you were able to read and understand all written signs...?

5. Do You Live as an Expat in an Arab Country?

Living in a country without being able to understand its language, can be frustrating. It makes you feel like a stranger, regardless of how long you stay. If you are an expatriate in an Arab country, you have probably realized how much easier, and also enjoyable, your daily life would be if you knew how to read and speak Arabic.

6. Are You Planning for a Job in an Arab Country?

With the Arab economies set on steady growth, professionals in various fields are in high demand. Knowledge of Arabic can increase your chances of getting an interesting and rewarding job in an Arab country.

Examples of professions where knowledge of Arabic is desirable: Foreign Correspondent, Translator, Technical Engineer, Geologist, Banker, International Consultant, Foreign Service Officer, International Lawyer, Teacher, Researcher, Doctor, Nurse, Dentist, and Social Worker.

7. Do You Have an Interest in Arab Culture and Affairs?

""What would you like to drink?"" A common question, and gesture of hospitality, in the Arab world. Getting to the roots of Arab culture is best done through its most cherished treasure - the Arabic language. The traditional hospitality of the Arabs, which visitors to the Arab world often have the pleasure to witness, becomes even more cordial when the guest shows an ambition to communicate in Arabic. The guest is not expected to speak perfect Arabic, and it is the good intention that counts. Even a few words are appreciated. Whether your contacts are social or business, knowledge of Arabic is likely to boost your status, and help foster trust and solid relationships.

8. Do You Have Arab Family Members?

Maybe you have relatives or friends from an Arab country. Learning to communicate with Arab family members or friends in their own language can be both interesting and fun. It can add a whole new dimension to your life. It would enable you to better understand their emotions and thinking patterns. And you would surely benefit personally from the positive impact this would have on yourself.

9. Does Your Work Involve Contacts with Arab Immigrant Communities?

If your type of work includes contact with Arab immigrants, knowledge of Arabic can facilitate your work and improve relations between yourself and your clients.

10. Do You Enjoy the Challenge of Learning New Languages?

Maybe you are keen to learn a new language, but you want to try something different... something more exotic... a more ""unusual"" type of language...Some simply start learning Arabic ""for the heck of it""... Learning Arabic can be challenging, but the reward is great, once you begin to appreciate the unique beauty and richness of this great language.

Convinced that learning Arabic is worth trying? Begin your studies the easy way right here.

How to Learn Arabic Right the First Time,"How to Learn Arabic Right the First Time

Arabic is a rich and fascinating language, and one of the most widely spoken in the world. In this article, I’ll explain why I think Arabic is a great language to learn. I’ll clear up a few myths, explain how to work out which kind of Arabic is right for you (spoiler alert: there’s more than one), and I’ll explain some basics of the language.

WHY LEARN ARABIC?

There are many good reasons to learn Arabic. Here are four.

Arabic is an extremely versatile language. It’s the fifth most spoken language in the world, and twenty-five countries consider Arabic an official language. There aren’t many other languages that you can use in this many different places. Arabic will help you to access one of the world’s most historic regions. From Marrakesh to Cairo, Beirut to Damascus, Jerusalem to Muscat, Arabic will help you to navigate these ancient cities and uncover their inner secrets – much more easily than you ever could in English. Arabic is more than just a means of communication. An understanding of the language will also help you to appreciate the rich artistic, musical, literary and religious life of Arabic-speaking countries. You’re likely to be appreciated. Native speakers of Arabic know that foreigners are often reluctant to learn their language. This means that any ability to speak Arabic is typically received warmly, regardless of how imperfect your grammar may be!

SOME ARABIC MYTHS

Let’s clear up a few myths that can put people off learning Arabic.

Arabic is too hard unless you’re a language superstar

It’s true that Arabic is a tricky language. It ranks somewhere below Japanese, Mandarin and one or two others when ranked by difficulty for native English speakers to learn. But there’s no special talent required to learn a language, including Arabic. Often, people who feel they’re not ‘good’ at languages just weren’t motivated to learn them at school, or had some other negative experience.

Success with Arabic is mainly about knowing what you’re aiming for and finding ways to practice as much as possible. It’s also really important to know that there are different kinds of Arabic, some quite a bit easier than others – more on this later!

Reading right-to-left will make my brain hurt

Arabic script reads in the opposite direction to English and people sometimes assume that this will be difficult to manage. In fact, you hardly need to think about it. Try reading English from right to left: it simply doesn’t work. Arabic is the same. Once you’ve learnt the letters, they show you where to go.

The script is indecipherable

Any new script is confusing at first. This includes the letters you’re reading now when you first encountered them as a child. As you practise Arabic, the letters will become easier and easier to recognise, and before long you’ll be recognising whole words – in other words, reading!

The Middle East is really dangerous

It’s true that there are parts of the region that are, unfortunately, currently off-limits due to conflict. But these are limited and the Arabic-speaking world is a big place, stretching from North Africa, across the Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine and Israel), through Iraq, and beyond to the Arabian Peninsula. Moreover, street crime rates are often lower than in Western cities so it can actually be safer.

BUT WAIT: THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS “ARABIC’

In my own journey to learn Arabic, in London, Amman and Beirut, I met dozens, probably hundreds, of Arabic students and teachers. We would often compare our experiences of learning the language. Based on these conversations and my own experience, I wrote a book to help new learners succeed with the language: ‘Thirteen Ways to Make a Plural: Preparing to Learn Arabic’.

I’ve squeezed as much of the advice from the book into this article as I can. But the single most important piece of advice I’d give anyone starting out with the language is that there is no such thing as “Arabic”. There are in fact various forms of Arabic. Before you dive into the language it is essential that you understand what they are – and work out a plan that’s right for you.

Here’s what you need to know.

The difference between Modern Standard Arabic and regional Arabic dialects

Getting this bit right could save you a whole lot of time down the line. The big division is between (1) Modern Standard Arabic, otherwise known as MSA or stan­dard Arabic, and (2) colloquial Arabic, also known as dialect.

Standard Arabic

Standard Arabic is formal, and often regarded as “proper”, Arabic. It is consistent across the Arabic-speaking world and used in news reporting, speeches, very formal settings, and almost all written material. The vocabulary is very large and the grammar is complex. For everyday, informal settings, it is cumbersome, unwieldy and sounds inappropriately formal to a native speaker’s ear. Most people will understand if you speak in standard Arabic but they will usually respond in colloquial Arabic.

Colloquial Arabic

Colloquial Arabic refers to the various local dialects found across the Arabic-speaking world. Simplifying a bit, Jor­dan, Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon broadly share one dialect. Iraqi, Gulf, and Egyptian Arabic are three further main dialects. The Arabic spoken in other north Afri­can countries (Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria) forms another dialect group, with some significant variations.

Colloquial Arabic has less grammar than standard Arabic, a smaller vocabulary and simpler verb conjugations. Less elegant but more practical, it is the language of daily life and used among friends, family, and colleagues in all kinds of social and work settings.

An example of the difference between standard and colloquial Arabic

Here is an example of how an everyday sentence can vary between types of Arabic. To ask “would you like to sit inside because the weather is cold?” in standard Arabic, you would say:

هل تريدون ان تجلسوا في الداخل لان الطقس بارد؟

Written in Latin script, this is: hal tureeduna an tajlisu fi ad-daakhil li-anna at-taqs baarid?

In the colloquial Arabic of the Levant region this might become:

بدكم تقعدو جوّا عشان الجو بارد؟

Or: bidkum tuq‘udu juwwa ‘ashaan aj-jaww baarid?

Even without understanding the words, you can see that the colloquial version is shorter. This is mainly because the formal sentence structures of standard Arabic, which can be rather long-winded, are removed. In terms of the vocabulary, very little remains of the standard Arabic version except for the final word, baarid, which means cold. Typically, everyday topics have different vocabulary in colloquial Arabic, like in this example.

BUILD YOUR ARABIC ROADMAP

First, ask yourself why you want to learn Arabic

Now that we’re clear on the ‘menu’ when it comes to the types of Arabic, it’s important to be clear on what you’re learning Arabic for. This will ensure you’re heading in the right direction from day one.

For example, do you want to learn Arabic as a professional skill? To smooth the way while travelling in Arab-speaking countries? To understand the Quran? To use for daily life while living in the region? To speak to your partner’s Arabic-speaking parents? Or perhaps a simple fascination with the language?

The answer will determine the kind of Arabic that you need.

In some cases, the answer is easy: if you’re going to be travelling in Egypt, for example, your best choice would be colloquial Egyptian Arabic, the language of daily conversation. If you want to be able to read a newspaper and understand al-Jazeera, you’ll need standard Arabic.

If you want to use Arabic in a professional context, it depends how you’ll be using it so you’ll need to dig a bit deeper. A journalist looking to build contacts and research local stories without a translator, for example, would need colloquial Arabic. But a researcher planning on reviewing library archives would need to be able to read, requiring standard Arabic.

Next, consider the level you want to achieve and the time you have available.

The big point here is that colloquial Arabic is much easier, making it faster to learn. You can expect to be having simple conversations in a couple of months. Modern standard will take longer – more like three to four months to reach this level.

Here’s a table of the approximate time it’s likely to take to reach different levels, based on full-time study and regular practice.

Description Modern Standard Colloquial / Dialect

(Harder to estimate as strongly influenced by amount of practice outside classroom. These timings assume significant real-life practice and includes learning to read Arabic. ) Competent professional use 18 months (Dependent on extent of real-world practice, difficult to estimate) Discussion of substantial issues 8-9 months 4-5 months Discussion of familiar topics 5-6 months 3-4 months Simple conversation 3-4 months 1-2 months Basic phrases and questions 2 months < 1 month

Check that you can commit the time you’ll need to reach the level you want in the kind of Arabic that works for you. And that’s your roadmap.

BEGINNER TIPS FOR LEARNING ARABIC

Next, let’s look at the language itself. Most of what follows here will refer to Modern Standard Arabic, because that is the ‘base’ of the language from which dialects have evolved.

Arabic script

At the most basic level, Arabic is like English: letters form words, and words form sentences. This is a huge advantage compared with languages such as Japanese or Mandarin, where characters are used to represent words and must be memorised individually.

Arabic pronunciation is also very regular – meaning that if you can read it, you can say it – unlike English which is full of irregular spellings and letter combinations. The twist with Arabic is the vowels, which I’ll come to later.

First, I’ll look at Arabic sounds and the alphabet.

The Arabic alphabet has 28 letters. There are no capitals, and many are based on similar shapes which makes learning them straightforward.

Many of the letters have sounds that are also found in English. Here are some of them:

ب – ‘b’

د – d’

م – ‘m’

ل – ‘l’

ج – ‘j’

س – ‘s’

ت – ‘t’

ر – ‘r’

Other letters represent sounds not found in English. These include:

ق – a ‘q’ sound produced half way down the throat

ع – sounds a bit like a momentary strangulation

ح – a heavy ‘h’ produced deep in the throat

ص – a heavy ‘s’ produced with the back of the tongue higher in the mouth

خ – a rasping sound usually written in English as ‘kh’

These unfamiliar sounds can feel intimidating at first but don’t be put off. They’re not really hard, they’re just unfamiliar. With a little practice, you’ll be able to say them all. And it doesn’t matter if your pronunciation isn’t perfect. Most of the time people will still be able to understand you.

You can learn the alphabet in just a few hours. Arabic is a cursive script, meaning the letters generally join those before and after. In many cases the shape is modified to allow the join. It’ll take a few more hours to get the hang of how the letters connect with one another. By then, you’ll already have taken the first step toward reading – and Arabic will no longer be merely squiggles and dots!

Learning without the Arabic script

If you’re learning colloquial Arabic you have the option of skipping Arabic script altogether, since it can be approximated with the Latin script.

For example, “studying Arabic grammar is fun” would be written in Arabic as:

دراسة قواعد اللغة العربية ممتعة

This will take a bit of study before you can read it. But simplified into Latin script, it reads:

Daraasat quwa’aid al-lugha al-‘arabiya mumti’a

Sure, there are still a few sounds that you’ll need to learn to pronounce. But that aside, you’re already reading and speaking Arabic.

This approach can make learning Arabic vocabulary and starting to speak much faster. The downside is that the pronunciation is less precise and you won’t get that deeper understanding of the patterns and structures of the language that comes with learning the writing system.

I therefore don’t recommend Latin script for those learning Modern Standard Arabic. But if you’re learning colloquial, particularly if you’re interested in just picking up the basics and are not concerned about reading, it’s a great way to get speaking more quickly.

Vowels

You may have wondered where some of the vowels are. Here’s the catch: the short vowels in Arabic aren’t written. You’ll see the long vowels represented by ي (ee), و (oo) and ا (aa). But while the short vowel sounds can be written as symbols above or below the letters they are usually omitted, other than in religious texts and children’s books.

For example:

girl = بنت (pronounced “bint”) This consists of the letters ب (‘b’), ن (‘n’) and ت (‘t’) but you’ll notice that the “i” isn’t shown.

countryside = بلد (pronounced “balad”) Here, ب (‘b’), ل (‘l’) and د (‘d’) combine to make the word. Again, the vowels are left out.

At first, this can feel confusing. But as you become more familiar with the language, it becomes easier. The vowels for frequently used words will stick through regular use. And the vowels of longer words are often predictable from the shape of the word thanks to the regular patterns of Arabic.

Verbs and patterns

Let’s look more closely at this idea of patterns. At the heart of Arabic is its remarkable verb system, whereby basic verbs are adapted to produce related words. Once you get a feel for it, it will give you a huge advantage in learning the language.

Here’s how it works.

Almost all verbs are based on three root letters. These root letters are expanded in a variety of ways, often following predictable patterns, to produce new words.

For example:

درس (darasa) is a basic verb made up of the three root letters س ,ر ,د (d, r, s). It means “to study”.

Doubling the middle letter of a basic verb (by placing a symbol known as a shadda above it) often creates the meaning of ‘doing’ the action to someone else. Here, we get درّس (darrasa), meaning “to teach” – in other words, the idea of ‘study’ directed at another person.

Verbs provide the basis for related nouns as well. Using the same example:

درس – “dars”, a lesson or class.

دراسة – “daraasa”, studying or a study/survey.

مدرسة – “madrasa”, a school. Adding an ‘م’, or ‘m’ to the start of a word is a frequent way of creating the place associated with the meaning.

مدرّس – “mudarris”, meaning ‘teacher’. Here, the root letters have been modified according to a common pattern to produce the word for the person who ‘does’ the verb.

تدريس – “tadrees”, which means ‘teaching’. Here, two letters, ت and ي (‘t’ and ‘ee’), have been added to the verb درّس, which as we saw above means “to teach”. This follows a standard pattern used to produce the equivalent of an English noun ending in ‘-ing’, or gerund.

Learning a set of similar words around a theme is much easier than memorising a bunch of disconnected words, as is the case with most languages. In Arabic, new words will often resemble one you already know, providing a memory hook. This also means that you can sometimes guess the meaning of new words from the root letters.

Creating sentences

Here’s how we can take some of the words above to make a simple sentence.

First, a little more vocabulary:

كل – every (“kul”)

يوم – day (“yawm”)

في – in/inside (“fee”)

We’ve already seen that درس means “to study”. To make this “she studies”, just add a ت, making تدرس (“tadrus”).

Now, you can already say:

البنت تدرس كل يوم – the girl studies every day (“al-bint tadrus kul yawm”)

Or:

البنت تدرس في المدرسة – the girl studies in the school (“al-bint tadrus fil-madrasa”)

After reading one blog, you’re already seeing how to construct sentences. Arabic may be classed as a hard language, but with the right approach, it doesn’t have to be!"

Two of My Favourite Arabic Blogs,"مُدَوَّنَة

root: د-و-ن / noun / plural: مُدَوَّنات / definition: a blog

The Arabic Pages certainly isn’t the only blog out there focused on the Arabic language, and I’ve come across so many brilliant online resources since I started studying Arabic.

My intention is to (eventually) make a list of all the best Arabic resources so I don’t lose any in my scattered notes and the sea of tabs I have open on various devices. But while that’s on hold, I really wanted to share with you two Arabic blogs that I love reading.

The first is the amazing Arabic for Nerds run by Gerald Drißner.

If either of those two names sound familiar, then you might be remembering my book review of (or—more aptly—my excited rambling about) Drißner’s seriously good Arabic grammar book, Arabic for Nerds 2.

On the Arabic for Nerds blog, you’ll find so many impressive posts about grammar, as well as resources and recommendations.

I also advise checking out the 9273 roots series, where Drißner asks other Arabic enthusiasts 20 questions related to the language and their experiences with it. You’ll likely pick up some cool recommendations there too, as well as new vocabulary!

As for the second blog I wanted to mention, it’s The Arabic Student.

While you can find posts on this blog about MSA and various other dialects, I think those learning Levantine Arabic will find it particularly useful.

The Arabic Student has a collection of posts about the Levantine dialect which are mainly based on media clips. The blogger writes out the transcript of clips from TV shows, for example, and then explains the language used. You can tell that so much time and effort went into these posts and the results are super useful for the rest of us.

Unfortunately, The Arabic Student blog is no longer active, with the last post being years ago. But there’s definitely enough there to benefit from. (And you can check out the videos on the YouTube channel too!)

So, these are just two of the Arabic resources I love, but what about you? What are your favourite Arabic-related blogs or online resources? Let us know in the comments below!

And if you’d like to read about some more resources, take a look through these posts.
