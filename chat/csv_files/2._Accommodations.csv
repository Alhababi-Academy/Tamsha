Essence of AlUla,
"Stay Another Day: AlUla, Saudi Arabia","Known for its breathtaking ancient ruins and soaring sandstone formations, AlUla is quickly becoming a must-visit destination, offering a growing array of diverse experiences and accommodations.

Beyond its renowned archaeological treasures, travellers can explore the desert landscape – a playground for adventure enthusiasts – with opportunities for hiking, biking and stargazing.

For a more leisurely escape, AlUla offers luxurious accommodations, world-class dining and a thriving art scene. As the town continues to develop, a busy calendar of art installations, music performances and festivals await.

Read on to learn more about extended stays in AlUla!"
The Red Sea coast(Saudi Arabia)SO3Ep26 – Overland Diaries,"One of the most difficult moments in overlanding as mentioned in the past is when you leave from a place that has won your heart. We must admit that leaving Najran was not an easy decision but as the journey goes on, we said goodbye to our friends and left Najran behind.

Our next destination was the regional capital of the tiny Saudi province of Jazan. This town was an anchorage for vessels travelling between the hinterland and the Hejaz, Yemen and the Indian Ocean. Later it was involved in the regional coffee trade and finally became a pearl trade epicenter.

For us, this Red Sea port served as a gateway to the Farasan Islands. Although we had no plans to stay there, we arrived late in the day (Voukefalas had been having fuel issues lately so we had to take it easy) and the boat had already left. So we registered, got our free tickets for the next day’s boat and planned to spend the night there. Keep in mind that this is an extremely hot place so with a quick drive-by look, in an hour or so, from the comfort of our vehicles air-con, to the Ottoman fort that overlooks the city and the lively port area, we retreated to an air-con room for the rest of the day as the heat was unbearable (45 degrees).

The next morning, after an X-ray check of our vehicle from the port authorities (as still in war with Yemen, strict security is necessary) we boarded the ferry to Farasan Islands. The plankton rich waters surrounding these islands are home to rays, dolphins, whale sharks and several endangered species of turtle.

They are also home to some of the few remaining stretches of coastal mangrove along the Red Sea, the habitat of the endangered dugong. With all this marine life stated in every brochure we got our hands on, I couldn’t wait to hit the waters with a regulator in my mouth. Unfortunately that was not the case! Ramadan was still in its peak and most of the shops including the diving ones were closed. In land, beside visiting the neighborhoods of the old pearl merchants, our attempt to visit Al Qessar,a collection of simple mud, coral and reed structures, failed as the heritage village was also closed, leaving us no other option than a sneak pick of the houses from outside. After one more night in a seaside recreational park that we called home during our stay here and with the daily heat immobilizing us for the most part of the day, under any sort of shade we could find (it reached 46 degrees in the shade) we made the decision to book our ticket and return to the mainland. We can’t say that we were disappointed or that it wasn’t worth our visit there because for one more time just the people we met and their warm welcome made us feel like home.

At this point our priority was an escape from the heat and that came in the form of a mountainous city that we have read about. Abha, except being the ideal base to explore the Asir National Park and its mysterious villages, also has cooler temperatures as it is nestled in the green, mountainous interior. Sitting 2200m above sea level, Abha can be bathed in sunshine one minute and shrouded in mist and fog the next.

This is the city contrary to everything you might expect out of Saudi Arabia. We spent a couple of days enjoying the cool climate in Asir National Park, as well as exploring the city and its surroundings before we moved back to the coast of the Red Sea for a quick overnight in Al Lith, on the south west of the holy city of Mecca. As Al Lith has no real attractions except its small compact waterfront area, the next day we took the highway for Jeddah.

We decided to give a miss to both of the two holiest cities of Islam, Mecca and Medina, as we have been told that during Ramadan they get way overcrowded with pilgrims from all over the Islamic world.

Jeddah is the historic crossroads of pilgrims and traders, as well as the most fascinating city of Saudi Arabia’s major cities. With a cosmopolitan and liberal air not present anywhere else in the kingdom, someone can enjoy the city’s World Heritage Red Sea architecture, bustling souks, laid-back coastline and its diverse, world class cuisine.

We were lucky to be hosted by a world class chef and good friend , Ali that except allowing us to stay in his house, he introduced us to some of the best restaurants in town while spoiling us with great homemade dishes each time at home. It couldn’t get any better! Besides being the commercial capital of Saudi Arabia, modern Jeddah is more than a thousand times the size of the ancient city where it is believed the mother of humanity, Eve, was laid to rest. It is a fast-paced city and a bit rough around the edges, with high-rises and a waterfront culture that are symbols of the kingdom’s modernization. This blend of old and new is what makes the ”Bride of the Red Sea” such an appealing destination that often is the first Saudi city foreigners like to visit.

There, except being spoiled by Ali’s hospitality, we decided that it was time to look into Voukefalas’ fuel problem that was first developed back in Australia but here with the all the off road routes and the uphill drives had gotten worse. So we booked an appointment with a mechanic in order to have it fixed. Worth mentioning here is that the time for the appointment we got was set for 10pm at night. During the day, in Ramadan, people fast from sunrise to sunset and therefore any movement in daytime hours is minimized (shops close, office hours change and so on). That is not the case for the night that everything comes to life and things start happening after the sun has set and they have broken the fast. After finding the issue, our mechanic had to drop our fuel tank and clean it.

A really time consuming job that took lots of effort! Almost ten years of diesel flow of fuel from all types of pumps around the world had caused a huge clog in the fuel lines that starved our engine. To cut the story short and at almost 2am, Voukefalas was as good as new and it was time to pay our bill. ”Consider this as our welcome to you in our country” was the words of Abu Fatwa (the head mechanic) for the bill! We were in shock! Now you can understand why we go on and on about the hospitality and the people of this country. After being almost around half of the planet, we have not experience hospitality at this level anywhere else! From Ali’s offer to allow us to take over his house to Abu Fatwa (our mechanic) and Mani from Najran to the fisherman in Farasan Islands and to all the other people we came across, we thank you for making us feel emotionally connected to this country.

After our unforgettable stay in Jeddah, our time to move on had come once more. The goodbyes were as always hard but we were sure that we would be back one day and that made things a bit easier. Moving further 80 kilometers north of Jeddah, on the coast of the Red Sea, we stopped for the night in Thuwal, a Hejazi village in the Makkah Province of Saudi Arabia.

The next day our aim was to reach Yanbu, that is a fast becoming an appealing tourist destination, due to its amazing pristine white sandy shores. However, at first glance, the backdrop of refineries and petrochemical plants shocked us and hardly painted the area as an attractive highlight. Fortunately, this was the new Yanbu, which sits 15km south of old Yanbu. Old Yanbu has a history dating back 2500 years but in more recent times it is remembered as the place where TE Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) stayed.

Yanbu’s modest old town is small and easy to navigate but also well preserved and quaint, while just at the north of the town is where the vast, open desert gives way to blue waters. This is the area that is really worth spending your time. There we had arranged another overlanders’ meet up with a Greek biker that we met via social media and was also traveling in the region. Konstantinos is a travel writer and has been traveling the globe for many years. Sharing travel stories over a Greek cooked dinner was a great experience. After a couple of days in the sea and the sun, we turned inwards and toward the country’s best known highlight.

Al Ula is a small village that is nestled in a large, spectacular valley with palm groves running down the centre of a wadi (dry riverbed) and red-sandstone cliffs rising up on either side. It has a delightfully mysterious air about it as it is the gateway to Saudi Arabia’s version of Petra, Madain Salah, a World Heritage Site. The old-town ruins are among the best examples of traditional northern Arab architecture, with a history that stretches back to the 6th century BC and it is surrounded by pre-Islamic sites. The city’s strategic location along several trade routes for spices and incense coming from the Levant, Egypt and North Africa made it an important hub of that time.

After a meal and a bit of exploring in one of the shaded areas of the valley (still in the 38 degrees heat) we picked the natural formation of the Elephant Rock to camp for the night. This area is a part of the environmentally conscious plan of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman and has been developed in harmony with cafes and small restaurants, while the elephant shaped rock in the background creates a peaceful place to relax. A bit away, and as the desert starts calming the land, we found shelter under the red-sandstone cliffs for the night overlooking this surreal setting. The next day we paid a visit to the often dubbed ”second Petra”, Madain Salah, that for many is equal, if not more impressive, than its famous cousin across the border in Jordan. Both of these ancient settlements were major trading cities along the Nabataean trade routes, as confirmed by recent excavations of houses and a market area for traders and caravans. However here it is the 131 enigmatic tombs, which combine elements of Greco-Roman, Nabataean and Babylonian, that grab all the attention. Although the site was not fully open to public, the well organized tour provided with the entrance fee gave us a great introduction, revealing many of the essential elements of Nabataean funerary architecture. As our guide informed us, there was some archaeological evidence of plaster work and suggested that people feasted outside familial tombs – a Nabataean version of the Day of the Dead, I assume. Away from the ruins and in the valleys surrounding this area, the Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman is developing a number of exclusive hotel complexes, which have some impressive architectural features that we needed to see. Sculptures from different artists decorating the desert plains, a 5star hotel that uses retro airstream caravans as rooms for its guests and the largest mirrored building in the world, measuring 9,740 square meters, were just some of them.

The Maraya concert hall (Maraya means reflection or mirror in Arabic) was designed to reflect and highlight the natural beauty of the desert environment around Al Ula. The pictures we got with the reflections of the surroundings on the building were at least mesmerizing as you can imagine. After a total of four nights spent around Al Ula and our Elephant Rock free camp, we headed a bit further north to the last highlight of this area, the hanging bridge. It is another photogenic natural rock formation that captured our camera lens. Later that day, we returned for one more time to the Red Sea coast in Dhuba.

Dhuba or Dhiba (we saw it written both ways) is a small port in northwestern Saudi Arabia that serves as a supply line for the new build cross-border city of NEOM Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman latest project. In our plans was to spend our time in the area, while following the coast up all the way to the Jordanian border but the development of NEOM had blocked all access to the sea. Limited in areas to visit, we reached the Catalina plane wreck that lies in the tip of a small cape and camped in the only stretch of beach that we were allowed. The following days and with the permission of the friendly coast guard that came by our camp a couple of times (the area is heavily patrolled as it is right across Egypt) we enjoyed the undeveloped Saudi’s northern Red Sea coast that currently has some of the country’s least visited beaches. In fact, this was the least developed stretch of the Red Sea in the entire kingdom in our experience, with much of it literally just desert fading away into the sea, completed with camels roaming in the sun on the empty shore. A surreal sight to see! We were told that this situation is about to change, though, as stretches of this barren coastline are being developed into resorts. Fortunately, isolated spots are likely to remain for quite some time yet, so hurry up and get there before this natural beauty is gone forever.

The last chapter of our Saudi expedition started in Tabuk, a growing tourist destination, where we regrouped after many days of free camping on the coast and got ready for what proved to be the best memory before we said goodbye to Saudi Arabia. Wadi Disah, our very last destination in the country, is a mountainous region and one of the most beautiful natural landscapes in Saudi Arabia. The valley lies 400 meters above sea level and it is nestled between towering escarpments. The Wadi itself has two entrances and although the southern entrance is considered the most beautiful and most visited one, we, driven by our GPS as most of the time, picked to enter from the north and take our time enjoying this natural wonder.

Al Disah translates in our guidebooks as ”the valley of palm trees”. When you arrive there, you see exactly why. The luscious valley floor is surrounded by massive sandstone cliffs and pillars that are perfect for exploration. There are a lot of different things to do there but our focus was the off road route through the Wadi, characterized by freshwater crossings of natural springs and palm oasis with thick shade to camp. This place was such a joy that we drove from north to south and back a couple of times, spending a number of nights camped in different places within the Wadi. Finally, it would be fair to say that there would be no better way to finish our stay in the kingdom than Wadi Disah.

The circle had been completed and after a total of three months in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia it was time to take the road towards the border and enter into Jordan. I find it difficult to write the right words in order to do justice and describe how spectacular this country was and how impressed we were with each and every one of the people we met. All we can conclude is that the real journey of discovering this country was not in the search of only new landscapes, but gaining a whole new perspective of the way you experience this newly opened country to the world and the people living in it as a whole. See you soon, KSA!!! [:]"
Saudi Arabia Tailored Tours Crafted by Local Experts,"Experiencing the rich cultural heritage and traditions of Saudi Arabia, deeply rooted in Islamic history, provides a profound understanding of a significant aspect of Middle Eastern culture.

The country is home to numerous historical sites, including UNESCO World Heritage Sites like Madain Saleh, which offer a glimpse into ancient civilizations and the evolution of the region."
Hotels in Saudi Arabia,"Explore and find Hotels in Saudi Arabia

A vast country spanning most of the Arabian peninsula, Saudi Arabia is a land of ancient deserts, undulating dunes, historic ruins and the holiest of cultures. The northern region boasts the intricately rock-hewn Madain Saleh, an ancient ruin of tombs that dates back to the 1st century, while the southeastern ‘Empty Quarter’ is the one of largest deserts in the world. But Saudi Arabia’s main calling cards are Mecca and Medina, Islam’s most sacred sites. While non-Muslims are forbidden from entering these holy cities, it is a religious requirement for all physically and financially able Muslims to make the pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime. The rewards for those that do get there are substantial. The Great Mosque of Mecca is the largest in the world, and surrounds Islam’s holiest palace, the Kaaba, where up to four million people can pray at once. In addition to this, Medina’s Al-Masjid an-Nabawi mosque is said to have been built by the Prophet Muhammad himself, who was later buried here. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s throbbing capital, is more relaxed in its ways. Anyone can come here to enjoy a lively café culture, mud-brick palaces, and shopping options from traditional souks to extravagant malls. Meanwhile, the port city of Jeddah features a beautiful old town, a waterfront, and a string of beach resorts. You can find lots of hotels and resorts here, as well as in Riyadh and other big cities like central Buraidah and Dammam, on the east coast. Accommodation is available for Muslims only in Mecca and Medina."

Essential food and drink

Mezze; Truly one of the joys of Arab world cooking and similar in conception to Spanish Tapas, with infinite possibilities.

Fuul: Mashed Fava beans served with olive oil and often eaten for breakfast.

Shawarma: Ubiquitous kebab- or souvlaki style pita sandwich stuffed with meat.

Baby Camel: Among the tenderness of Saudi meats it’s a particular speciality of Jeddah and the Hejaz.

Red Sea seafood: Fresh and varied and at its best when slow cooked over coals or baked in the oven, try samak mashwi (fish basted in a date puree and barbecued over hot coals).

Khouzi: A bedouin dish of lamb stuffed with rice, nuts, onions, sultanas, spices, eggs, and a whole chicken.

Offices working hours;

0800 to 1800 (or less commonly) 0700 -1900 with a long break. By law the working hours’ week is 48 hours’ maximum and in the month of fasting in Ramadhan 30 hours per week.

DO’S AND DON’T’S:

Taking a Siesta: If the job allows follow local practice by eating your main meal at lunch time and taking a nap in the heat of the day. Drink plenty of water so you don’t become dehydrated. Wear cotton clothing, wear a hat and sunglasses.

Breaking the law in the Arabian Peninsula can have a severe consequence for westerners. Do not take photograph without permission. This is the case when photographing people, particularly women. You should also avoid military or strategic (such as airport and bus stop).

Greetings: shake hands readily with men but wait for an Arab woman to proffer her hand first. Don’t be surprised if people touch their heart after a greeting (as in Saudi) kisses on the cheek are exchanged between men (as in the gulf states).

Don’t enter a mosque during prayer times unless you are a Muslim. Don’t extend your feet in front of you while sitting: tuck them underneath in a slouched kneeling position.

Eco tourism in saudi arabia on the rise

Saudi Arabia, once synonymous with oil, is now charting a new path toward a sustainable future through a series of remarkable eco-tourism efforts. At the heart of the transformation is vision 2030: an ambitious plan to decrease the country’s oil dependence in part by increasing tourism to account for 10 percent of Saudi’s gross domestic product by 2030, up from 3 percent today. The vision outlines a plan for heightened sustainability efforts nationwide, from large-scale “giga-project” developments to a massive tree-planting campaign.

The red sea project

The luxury tourism development project spans an archipelago of 90 Islands on Saudi’s coast and the shores of the Tabuk province. The giga-project, announced in 2017, is meant to attract international tourism to these unspoiled Islands, create up to 70,000 jobs, and protect the eco system on the Red Sea Coastline.

Phase 1, which includes developing 5 Islands and two inland locations with 16 hotels offering about 3,000 rooms, is due to be completed and welcoming guests in 2024, with the entire project slated to be finished by 2030.

The neom project

The word NEOM translates to “new future”, and that’s exactly what this sprawling project in the Tabuk region aims to achieve, and in a sustainable fashion. A centre piece of Vision 2030 led by His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince and Chairman of the Board of directors of NEOM, this innovation hub-meets-living laboratory is another one of Saudi’s giga-projects. It will include smart towns and cities, research areas, enterprise zones, and entertainment spots. The project’s mission is to attract more than 1 million residents as well as tourists from around the world. In NEOM they address the greatest challenges facing humanity, by attracting elite minds and the best talents around the world, to build a committed society. We are facing a mission to redefine the future now, so the investment doors are open today in NEOM.

The Red Sea plan in Saudi Arabia is a brand-new tourism destination being built between the cities of Umluj and Al Wajh and along the country’s western coast. This site was picked because of its closeness to the infamous Red Sea, home to more than 90 pristine islands that have never seen people living there, and the fourth-largest barrier reef in the world.

The area around the project is home to many perplexing landscapes, such as dormant volcanoes, mountain canyons, and endless deserts interspersed with ancient cultural monuments. The project’s design also considered sustainability and the environment, drawing on various environmental research to inform the community’s objectives.

Additionally, discover the rich cultural past and plenty of historical and cultural attractions that make the Red Sea more than just a beautiful tourist destination.

Redefining Sustainable Development

In an era where environmental conservation and responsible tourism are increasingly crucial, the Red Sea plan in Saudi Arabia emerges as a trailblazing model of sustainable development. The master plan focuses on long-term sustainability and enhancing Saudi Arabia’s hospitality experiences. However, the strategy aims to preserve and improve marine and terrestrial habitats, infrastructure, architecture, landscape, and guest experience, setting ambitious standards for sustainable development.

At the heart of its mission lies a meticulous conservation strategy to safeguard the fragile ecosystems that call the Red Sea coastline home. The plan prioritizes limiting development to sensitive lagoon areas, protecting coral reefs, seagrass meadows, mangrove forests, and nesting habitats for preserving marine and avian species.

The project protects natural ecosystems and implements innovative infrastructural solutions that reduce environmental impact and enhance resource efficiency to build a sustainable tourism destination. From potable water generation to waste management, the project’s infrastructure is designed to uphold principles of sustainability while meeting the needs of visitors and residents alike.

Red Sea Project in Saudi Arabia extends its vision beyond environmental sustainability to embrace the concept of smart cities. However, the master plan focuses on a smart infrastructure framework for telecommunications, transit, and other urban services, aiming to enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors.

An environmentalist, Layla, says, “The project sets a new standard for responsible tourism development from renewable energy initiatives to innovative waste management practices. I am inspired by their dedication to preserving the natural beauty of the Red Sea for future generations and look forward to supporting their efforts in any way I can.”

Delivering Unlimited Experiences for the Long Term

The plan outlines a new town, an international airport, and more than 50 new hotels for the 35,000 people living and working in the development. It also offers a roadmap for the area’s short- and long-term prosperity.

More importantly, the master plan establishes natural preserves that support the survival of delicate marine and terrestrial ecosystems while prioritizing environmental effects. Moreover, the Red Sea Project fosters a sustainable future by integrating economic growth and environmental stewardship, preserving a unique landscape for future generations.

It is anything but ordinary. And as the spotlight continues to shine on this awe-inspiring desert, a meeting place for multiple cultures for thousands of years – its hotel scene continues to grow.

These are the best hotels in AlUla.

The Chedi Hegra

The newest addition to the hotel scene in AlUla is The Chedi Hegra. Known for opening the most stylish and memorable hotels and resorts in unique destinations worldwide, The Chedi by GHM Hotels in Hegra is home to a boutique collection of 35 rooms, three dining venues, a spa, and a swimming pool. Built directly into already existing structures including an old railway station, Hegra Fort, and surrounding buildings, there’s minimal interiors to bring the focus to the surrounding environment as well as custom lanterns and leather furniture honouring the heritage. Room categories range from the Chedi Deluxe Rooms to a Duplex Suite and a Two-Bedroom Pool Villa. At the hotel, you can pick from dining options like Prima Classe Restaurant, which invites diners to take a gastronomical journey from Paris and Venice due east to Cairo, creating flavours unlike any other. There’s also Al Mahatta, where you can go to enjoy some quiet contemplation in the amazing presence of handcrafted pastries, desserts, coffees, and mocktails. Lastly, there’s also a Saudi Coffee House where you can explore traditional Saudi coffee brewed with cardamom. Room rates currently start from SAR3,195 per night.

Dar Tantora

Named after AlUla’s famous sundial, Dar Tantora puts you right in the heart of the culturally-rich Old Town. The boutique 30 hotel rooms are made from sensitively restored mudbrick buildings, bringing back a touch of ancient living with just a hint of luxury. The eco-hotel gives guests a wonderful sense of history for an authentic AlUla experience. There are up to five rooms with traditional decor and minimal modern technology to ensure you can fully relax and go off the grid for a little bit, where everything is done by soothing candlelight. You can enjoy breakfast in the room or set up in the lush neighbouring Oasis, and all-day dining with a Saudi touch at Joontos. And you shouldn’t miss the rooftop café concept, Maqha. There’s also a special Saudi coffee room which will offer the finest of authentic local coffee experiences, locally sourced ingredients and a mixture of carefully handcrafted decor.

Banyan Tree AlUla

In a neat enclave in Ashar Valley you’ll find Banyan Tree AlUla, which has given a welcome glow-up to the former Ashar Resort while still maintaining that Bedouin-inspired luxury. The sprawling 300-hectare site means the resort requires a north and south side, although it’s easy enough to get scenic buggy rides from one side to the other. All villas have the same earthy palette of warm creams, terracotta and sand reflective of the surrounds, with rolling desert vistas enjoyed from floor-to-ceiling windows. Many rooms also have their own private pool, so guests can simply indulge in the privacy of their own digs should they wish – although a dip in the jaw-dropping Rock Pool, nestled between the rugged rocks – is an unmissable part of this resort. On-property, the resort has also bolstered an impressive programme of things to do, like star gazing and horse riding with local guides. As is customary with Banyan Tree, there’s a big focus on wellness – but even the spa has been designed to blend into its surroundings. Saffron Restaurant is a Banyan Tree signature Thai restaurant that benefits from stunning views at Banyan Tree AlUla’s north pavilion. All-day dining is given an AlUla upgrade with locally-inspired breakfast dishes, expansive desert views, and a lunch menu that includes an array of healthy juices and mocktails.

Habitas AlUla

Boutique eco-retreat Habitas made roots in the Ashar Valley of AlUla in 2021. Complete with 96 villas dotted across the vast desert landscape, rooms are set between manmade dunes for optimum privacy, and many feature epic mountain views from their private terraces. The best way to get around is on an electric bike, and there’s something truly freeing about whizzing through the valley that way (although there’s buggies too for those looking to give their legs a rest). The main restaurant Tama, which means ‘here and now’, is designed as a space for bringing guests together, with big lounge spaces and lots of long tables for dining in big groups. On the menu, nourishing dishes are globally influenced with a strong Middle Eastern presence, and ingredients sourced from local farms take centre stage. There’s a separate, open-air seating space, which leads out to a shimmering infinity pool: it’s the perfect spot to dip between the water and the relaxing ambience of the lounge. Habitas started as a community-focused series of events, so it makes sense that there’s plenty of other gathering spaces too, including the glass-lined reception, Moon Shell coffee lounge, and an open-air space for breathing workshops and meditation. Installations originally commissioned for the first Desert X AlUla are also shaped into the resort offering, allowing guests to ignite their inner child with a giant swing set backdropped by huge rock formations and trampolines hidden in the desert sands.

Caravan AlUla

Looking to really connect with the otherworldly AlUla landscape? Habitas has added a new string to its bow in the kingdom, which invites guests for a glamping experience – but not as you know it. Caravan AlUla is located a five-minute drive from the Habitas resort, so glampers checking-in benefit from all of the perks of the resort including Tama restaurant, access to the infinity pool and fitness and wellness spaces. Rather than Bedouin-inspired tents, accommodation here is in the form of retro Airstream trailers tucked into the AlUla valley. Each is fitted with cosy twin or neat double beds and has its own kitchenette, dining space and separate shower and toilet, making it a comfortable and well equipped base to serve as your AlUla starting point. It’s been given the Habitas treatment with a day bed fitted under a shaded terrace and soft furnishings in aztec prints scattered throughout. There’s separate facilities for Caravan by Habitas guests too, including the new Gathering Tent, where guests can connect over games under the shaded tent, an open-air cinema beaming films onto a rock face, and a duo of vintage food trucks where guests gather for fresh croissants at breakfast or pizzas in the afternoon.

Ashar Tented Resort

The understated, rustic design of Ashar Tented Resort is part of its charming allure, unrolling along the sandy plains of Ashar Valley. An elevated glamping resort, guests check-in to one of 44 boutique tents and villas dotted throughout the valley. Each of the deluxe digs, which come as either one- or two-bedroom configurations are designed with traditional Nabatean architecture in mind, with heritage prints, earthy tones and motifs inspired by the locale dictating the aesthetic. Inside, guests have all the facilities they could need for a comfortable stay, with en-suite bathrooms, AC and Wi-Fi in all rooms. All tents open out onto shaded decks that gaze out towards the magnificent views, while the villa rooms also come with private pools where you can cool off after a day of exploring. There’s a modern all-day dining restaurant on-site, while a short buggy ride away, guests can enjoy unrestricted access to the five-star facilities at Banyan Tree AlUla, including the spa and dazzling rock pool.

Cloud 7 Residence

One of the best hotels in AlUla for feeling like you’re close to the action, Cloud7 Residence is located on the outskirts of AlUla town. But it’s slightly off-beat location means Cloud7 benefits from vast vistas of some of the most spectacular scenery in AlUla, and everything is still easily accessible. Laid out like a quaint, low-rise complex of neat bungalows, it’s designed to allow guests to create connections not only with one another – thanks to an array of community-focused spaces – but also to connect with the local area. In your modern, stripped-back unit, there’s an open-plan living room and a well equipped kitchenette for self-catering. And each of the one-bedroom bungalows has a private terrace, where you can retreat at the end of the day for a peaceful moment of reflection. But Cloud7 Residence really shines in the communal areas, with an inviting pool lined with plush loungers serving as the perfect spot to sunbathe, snooze or relax with a book in hand.

Shaden Resort

One of the best hotels in AlUla for family stays is Shaden Resort. It’s one of the original AlUla hotels, so as such the aesthetic is more traditional than some of the destination’s newer counterparts. But that’s all part of the appeal. There’s a wide array of room options – from bright guest rooms that open up to terraces and balconies, to villas that come with their own private pools. For the ultimate group getaway, there’s a Royal Suite with six bedrooms, perfect for accommodating your whole crew. The resort’s physical and metaphorical heart is a super-sized swimming pool, dotted with rainbow-hued loungers and lined with fountains, where guests can gather, take a dip, or simply soak in the stunning AlUla surroundings. The leisure facilities are impressive, with an on-site hammam and a well-equipped gym, plus there’s three restaurants and a cafe to dine at, including the AlUla outpost of Saudi Arabia’s beloved Myazu. Tap the concierge to help you plan your ultimate AlUla itinerary, who can arrange activities including tours of Hegra, fruit picking or even ziplinging.

Sharaan Resort by Jean Nouvel

The luxurious 53-key resort will be split into suites and villas, with a fine-dining restaurant that will sit up a glass elevator and atop the mountain, offering panoramic views of the surroundings. Working in harmony with its environment, the resort’s construction is inspired by the Nabataean inhabitants who crafted their monuments as integral to the local landscape more than 2,000 years ago. The resort will also be home to an international summit centre which will host events and leaders from around the world, with a total of 13 hospitality pavilions.

Six Senses AlUla

A pioneering hospitality brand in the wellness, sustainability and ultra-luxury space, Six Senses AlUla will welcome guests from 2027. A collection of 100 guest villas and 25 residences promise to blend seamlessly into the surrounding natural oasis, which is framed by AlUla’s unmistakable red sandstone cliffs. On property, guests can look forward to wellness activities at the Six Senses Spa such as sunrise yoga and meditation, singing bowl ceremonies, and Arabian-inspired treatments. Culinary experiences will take place against the backdrop of the natural rocks and caves, where the interiors feature thousand-year-old inscriptions and rock drawings.

It’s set to be an immersion into the locale unlike any other in AlUla.

AlUla, Autograph Collection

Marriott will bring its Autograph Collection brand to AlUla in 2025, opening a 250-key property in the heart of downtown AlUla.

Abraj Kudai,"Hotel in Saudi Arabia

Abraj Kudai is a partially built hotel in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.[1] Originally projected to open in 2017, construction was halted in 2015 due to financial difficulties.[2] As of 2023, the hotel has yet to be opened to the public.[3] If completed, it will be one of the largest hotels in the world, consisting of a ring of 12 towers 45 stories high, with 10,000 bedrooms, 70 restaurants, and four rooftop helipads. There will also be five floors for the sole use of the Saudi royal family.[4] According to Arabian Business, 10 of the towers will provide four-star accommodations, while the other two towers will be reserved for special clientele offering five-star amenities.[5][6]

The estimated project cost is US$3.5 billion, and will cover approximately 1.4 million square metres.[7] The London-based firm Areen Hospitality has been contracted to design the hotel and the rooms' interiors.[5]

Controversy [ edit ]

As the owner of the Abraj Kudai project, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Finance is also a prime customer of The Saudi Binladin Group (SBL), one of the country's largest construction companies. The actions of the government directly affect SBL and so when low oil prices began propelling the government ""to cancel or suspend projects and delay payments"", SBL suffers too. Further exacerbating the situation, as reported by Gulf Business, was when one of SBL's cranes fell into the Grand Mosque in Mecca, resulting in 107 deaths and the company being banned ""from receiving new state contracts altogether."" In response to its potential financial collapse, the conglomerate laid off thousands of employees and stopped work on several important projects including Abraj Kudai.
